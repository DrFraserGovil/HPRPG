description = A newborn \imp{acromantula} is tiny when compared to their full grown counterparts – though with a legspan of up to 40cm\comma{} they are still significantly larger than almost all non\minus{}magical spiders. 

Their body is covered in a shiny\comma{} hairless and pale\minus{}grey carapace\comma{} which hardens and grows darker as they grow older – eventually they shed this skin as they enter the adult phase of their life. 

Despite their limited intelligence and diluted poison\comma{} \name{}s are often encountered in nauseating flocks of thousands upon thousands\comma{} and in such large numbers\comma{} they pose a deadly threat to even the most powerful magic user.}\encounterBeast{name = Acromantula Adult, species = Acromantula, mind = Sapient, category = Monstrosity, rating = V, abilities = \ability{Webwalker}{\article{} \name{} takes no movement penalty on webbed surfaces\comma{} and uses their \imp{Inhuman Senses} to sense vibrations in their webs.}

description = From a nest of several thousand \imp{Hatchlings}\comma{} only one or two survive the brutal and vicious ascent to adulthood within an \imp{Acromantula} colony\comma{} shedding their final adolescant carapace to become a full\minus{}grown \imp{Acromantula}.

As a result of this violent and competitive environment\comma{} a fully grown \imp{Acromantula} is something to be greatly feared. No \imp{Acromantula} survives this long without a willingness and ability to brutally slay even their closest allies\comma{} so that only the most murderous\comma{} brutal and cunning spiders remain. 

Though  they can run incredibly quickly and they utilise a ranged web attack to ensnare their pray\comma{} the most terrifying aspect of a full\minus{}grown \imp{Acromantula} is their above\minus{}human level of intelligence\comma{} not only can they liquiefy your innards\comma{} they can counter even the most elaborate plan to outwit them.}\encounterBeast{name = Acromantula Patriarch, species = Acromantula, mind = Sapient, category = Monstrosity, rating = VI, abilities = \ability{Webwalker}{\article{} \name{} takes no movement penalty on webbed surfaces\comma{} and uses their \imp{Inhuman Senses} to sense vibrations in their webs.}

participants = { {Aragog}}, 
description = If it is rare for a \imp{Hatchling} to survive to adulthood\comma{} it is even rarer for an \imp{Acromantula} to grow old\comma{} and gain the mantle of the \imp{Patriarch}. 

As the \imp{Acromantula} never stop growing\comma{} by the time they reach 40 or 50 years old\comma{} they have reached truly gargantuan sizes\comma{} with legspans up to 10m\comma{} with an exoskeleton that is so thick that almost nothing can penetrate it. 

Though they cut a truly terrifying figure\comma{} their bodies have become decrepit with age\comma{} and they do not retain the nimbleness of their younger forms\comma{} instead relying on their formidable intellect and their ability to command legions of their brood to protect them.}}
