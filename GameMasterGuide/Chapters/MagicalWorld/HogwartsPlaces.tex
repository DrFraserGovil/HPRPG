\building{Grounds}{The \imp{Grounds} consist of all of the land outside of \imp{Hogwarts}. The grounds are bounded on two sides by a large stone wall\comma{} but the North and Eastern boundaries of the Grounds lie within the \imp{Forbidden Forest} – the actual extent of the \imp{Grounds} into the \imp{Forbidden Forest} is somewhat murky\comma{} and \imp{Hogwarts} exerts very little control over anything beyond the first few trees.}{

{\location{Quidditch Pitch}{The Quidditch pitch lies to the North\minus{}East of the \imp{Barbican}\comma{} along the very edge of the \imp{Forbidden Forest}. Oval in shape\comma{} with three sets of raised\comma{} golden hoops at either end\comma{} the pitch is surrounded by 4 enormous towers decorated in the colours of the 4 houses\comma{} from which spectators watch the aerial game.}
\location{The Great Lake}{The \imp{Great Lake} (also known as the \imp{Black Lake}) is a very large\comma{} freshwater lake lying within the grounds of \imp{Hogwarts}\comma{} with the majority of the lake lying between \imp{Hogwarts Castle} and \imp{Hogsmeade Station}. The main \imp{Keep} of \imp{Hogwarts} is built on a small island in the \imp{Black Lake}. 

Approximately half a mile across at its widest\comma{} the depths of the Lake have mostly been uncharted – primarily out of respect for the colony of \imp{Merpeople} and the \imp{Giant Squid} which reside in its inky waters.}
\location{Herbology Greenhouses}{Wrapped around the North\minus{}Eastern side of the \imp{Barbican} are a number of long\comma{} narrow Greenhouses\comma{} containing all manner of plants and plant\minus{}like creatures. It is here that students have their practical lessons in \imp{Herbology}\comma{} learning to care for and cultivate magical plants.}
}
}

\building{Keep}{The \imp{Keep} is the largest building at Hogwarts and\comma{} besides the various towers\comma{} it is also the tallest at a full seven stories tall. The \imp{Grand Staircase} spirals up through the centre of the \imp{Keep} allowing access to the various floors\comma{} which contain a large portion of the teaching rooms. 

The \imp{Keep} has three major entrances and exits – the \imp{Clocktower Courtyard}\comma{} the \imp{Viaduct Courtyard} and the multiple passageways and corridors which lead into the \imp{Central Tower}. Both the \imp{Keep} and the \imp{Central Tower} sit upon a small island close to the shore of the \imp{Great Lake} – access to the rest of the castle and the grounds is ensured through a number of bridges which span the cavernous divides.}{

\building{Headmaster’s Tower}{This almost impossibly narrow tower protrudes from the southern edge of the \imp{Keep}\comma{} starting from around the second floor\comma{} where entrance is gained behind a statue of a might golden griffin.
