\chapter{Cosmology}
\label{S:Cosmology}
Though little of it is talked about in the \imp{Wizarding World}, for the study of it is highly restricted, and confined almost entirely to the \key{Department of Mysteries} (and its various international variants), the universe is not as simple as it might first seem. 

It has been speculated for centuries by muggles that there exists aspects of reality that are, in some senses, {\it removed} from the world we see around us - be it the mystical kingdom of \imp{Olympus}, or the divine \imp{Heaven} and torturous \imp{Hell} of the Abrahamic religions. 

The truth, as always, is much more complex - but in general, it turns out that the myths and stories were not {\it too} far from the truth. 

There do indeed exist multiple realities beyond our own: isolated universes bound by their own magical and physical laws. These `realities' are known by a number of different names: \key{Realms}, \key{Dimension} and, most poetically, \key{Planes of Existence}.

Upon its creation, one of the primary goals of the \imp{Department of Mysteries} was the studying and cataloguing of the \imp{Realms} beyond our own. The information gained here is what has slowly become \imp{common knowledge} over the course of the past decades.

\section{Traversing the Realms}

As the \imp{Realms} are completely separate from the physical reality that we are able to percieve, getting there is no mean feat: you cannot simply walk or fly there. 

There are, however, places on this planet where the fabric between worlds has worn thin, where dimensions begin to bleed into each other. It is not uncommon for \key{Rifts} to form at these points - rips and tears in the fraying material of reality. Entering into these \imp{Rifts}, though a dangerous and unpredictable endeavour, will cause one to be catapaulted across the multiverse, into another \imp{Realm}.

Such \imp{Rifts} are, however, incredibly dangerous - they are inherently unstable, liable to opening and closing at a moment's notice, or shifting such that it deposits you a mile up in the air, under the ocean, or into the heart of a mountain. There is also no guarantee that a \imp{Rift} is traversible in both directions - careless uses of \imp{Rifts} are therefore prone to leaving the budding interdimensional explorer stranded on the other side. 

Powerful mages therefore prefer the use of \key{Portals}, created through the \imp{Traverse} spell. Whilst \imp{Rifts} are naturally occuring and unstable, \imp{portals} are artificial, magical creations - and therefore much more reliable. However, the creation of a portal - even one that lasts only a microsecond - is an act of great magical power, and therefore not attempted by many witches or wizards. 

Some immensely powerful magic users through history have, however, succeeded in this endeavour. There are myths and legends of witches who have travelled across the \imp{Void} to deal with the Devil, and mages who have delved deep into the \imp{Elemental Planes} to learn powerful new magics. Relics of these journeys can found in the form of a handful \key{Archways} - permanent, stable \imp{portals} - dotted across the Earth. 

Only a dozen or so of these mysterious objects have ever been discovered. Nobody knows who created them, and they seem to be so ancient as to predate the beginning of the historical record. The magical power and finesse required to open a permanent gateway into another dimension (without ripping the universe into itty-bitty pieces) are so immense that it seems unlikely that any human mage is responsible. The only \imp{Archway} to have been studied extensively lies within the \imp{Department of Mystery} itself (and was in fact the reason for the founding of the \imp{Ministry} at that location.)

This mysterious artefact is known as the \imp{Veil}, and seems to be a \imp{Archway} leading into \key{Hades}, the \imp{Realm} of death and decay. Why anyone would go to such effort to establish a permanent pathway to such an awful place remains unclear. 

\section{Cataloguing the Realms}

Though infamously reluctant to share their secrets, the \imp{Unspeakables} have slowly begun to reveal their understanding of the cosmos, and the \imp{Realms} that lie within it. Broadly speaking, they have been able to identify 
{
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep = 0em]
\item The \key{Mortal World}
\item The \key{Astral Plane}
\item The \key{Voidic Continuum}
\item The \key{Lower Planes}
\item The \key{Higher Planes}
\end{enumerate}
}

\realm{The Mortal World}{origin}{
The Mortal World is the universe that we see around us. It contains every star in the sky, every blade of grass beneath your feet, and is seemingly infinite in extent. 

Events in this World follow well-established rules, what the Muggles call `the laws of physics' - though the discerning mage knows that these `laws' may be tweaked somewhat by the use of magic.

Most Sapient beings go their entire life without knowing that there is anything besides the Mortal World in existence. 
}


\realm{The Astral Realm}{astral}
{
The \key{Astral Realm} is probably the plane that lies closest to the \imp{Mortal World}, and is often imagined by those who study it as a blanket, lying over the top of the \imp{mortal realm}.

This \imp{realm} is one of pure consciousness - thought and imagination hold sway here, rather than rigid laws and rules.  Visually, the \imp{Astral Realm} looks like a translucent mimicry of the mortal realm, filled with drifting mist, thick fog and ghostlike figures. 

Every point in the Mortal World has a corresponding point in the \imp{Astral Realm}, and every building, plant and person has their own reflection in this most mysterious of mirrors. These reflections are not of the object's physical form, but instead of the spirit and intent of the place - the fortress of an evil tyrant may appear as a cancerous and evil tree, whilst a hospital may appear as a radiant glade, suffused with peaceful energy. 

Despite the apparant similarities to our own world, the rules which govern space and time do not apply to the \imp{Astral Realm}, instead bending to the strongest will around. Travelling through this realm, therefore, is as simple as believing strongly enough that you are going somewhere, and you will surely find yourself heading (more or less) in the right direction, floating like a ghost through the wisps and the clouds. 

Beware, however: unless your mind is clear and your will is true, paths taken through the \imp{Astral Realm} tend to have a habit of not ending up where you expected them to. Many an explorer has walked in circles for days, despite always walking in a perfectly straight line. 

In this tumultous \imp{realm} of thought and ideas, the Past, present and future coexist all at once. It is from the \imp{astral realm}, therefore, that seers are able to glean information about the future - peering into the \imp{Astral Realm}, and imposing your will upon it, allows you to see beyond the paltry concerns of time and space. 

It is also speculated that when a wizard apparates, they actually briefly enter into the astral realm, traverse a path that either takes no time at all, or perhaps has no length at all (or maybe both?), and then exit again, finding themselves to have instantaneously transported. 

}

\realm{Voidic Continuum}{void}
{
It is perhaps best not to think of the \key{Voidic Continuum} as a \imp{Realm} (some would argue that it is best not to think of it at all). 

Instead, it is the infinite, multidimensional, incomprehensible `space' in which every other \imp{Realm} moves. Like the interstellar expanse of nothingness in which stars and galaxies move, the \imp{Void} is the sea upon which the \imp{Realms} float; tiny, insignificant pinpricks of light on a vast ocean of emptiness.

If you have found yourself in the \imp{Voidic Continuum}, you have surely lost your way. Stepping outside the normal notions of reality, time and space is not for the faint of heart. 

The \imp{Void} is empty. Not `empty' in the sense that a box can be empty, nor in the sense that intergalactic space can be empty. Compared to the \imp{Continuum}, those things are filled with life, teeming with energy. 

The \imp{Void} is absence, the total lack of {\it everything}: time, space, energy and matter all have no meaning here. 

The \imp{Void} is the opposite of reality, the negation of existence. So empty it is impossible to move within it, and so dark that no light can propragate. Even if you entered this domain with an ally, you would not be able to see them, feel them or even perceieve their existence. 

Despite this, their are whispers of creatures which have made their home here in the \imp{Voidic Continuum}, at the far reaches of the darkness, beyond even the \imp{Higher Planes}. Either having fled here from the justice of the \imp{Heavens} or the wrath of the \imp{Hells} and subsequently driven insane, or simply having always existed there since the dawn of existence. These entities have become (or were always) twisted, awful creatures of supreme cosmic horror, and are often referred to (in hushed tones) as \key{Eldritch Horrors}. 

The \imp{Eldritch Horrors} are entities beyond human comprehension, and go by many names: the \imp{Chaos Gods}, \imp{The Great Old Ones}, \imp{Devourer of Stars}, \imp{Harbingers of Apocalypse} to name but a few. They are not inherently evil, and are in fact so utterly alien that the concept of good and evil is barely applicable to beings of such comsic power. They are instead the \imp{Voidic Continuum} rendered incarnate: the antithesis of everything we consider to be true of living beings. 

Those who have attempted to study the \imp{Void} and the \imp{Eldritch Horrors} have generally gone mad within a matter of hours. It is something best left avoided.  
}

\realm{The Lower Planes}{lowerplanes}
{
	The \key{Lower Planes} is the collective name given to the \imp{Realms} which lie beyond the \imp{Astral Realm}, but which can be easily accessed from the \imp{Mortal World}. 
	
	If the \imp{Realms} are thought of as like stars floating in space, the \imp{Lower Realms} are simply those that are close enough to see from Earth, whilst the \imp{Higher Planes} are so far distant that they cannot be seen. 

	There are dozens, even hundreds of \imp{Lower Planes}. Some are as large as our universe, encompassing stars and galaxies, whilst others encompass only a small planet, or (in extreme cases) a single room. Some, like the \imp{Astral Realm}, are mimicries of the \imp{Mortal Realm}, whilst others are entirely separate: unique and alien.
	
	Many of the \imp{Realms} within the \imp{Lower Planes} find themselves dedicated to some elemental or conceptual concept familiar to us on Earth - whether it be \key{Vulcan}, a plane dominated by fire and combustion, or \imp{Scholomancia}, a library-like domain containing all knowledge ever discovered. 
	
	The \imp{Lower Planes} can therefore be categorised into the following groups:
	\begin{itemize}
		\keyItem{The Heavens}{Pleasant and beautiful realms embodying concepts such as peace, harmony, honour and bravery}
		\keyItem{The Hells}{Terrible landscapes filled with gruesome death, torture, war and terror.}
		\keyItem{The Primal Expanse}{A number of closely-linked planes dominated by basic, elemental concepts such as fire, and water, life and death}
		\keyItem{The Daedal Domains}{\imp{Realms} dedicated to and dominated by complexity, structure and nuance. Complex, multifaceted ideas are represented within the \imp{Deadal Domains}. }
	\end{itemize}
	
	A list of the charted \imp{Lower Planes} can be found later on in this chapter. 
}

\realm{The Higher Planes}{higherplane}
{
	There appears to be no meaningful, categorical distinction between the \imp{Lower Planes} and the \key{Higher Planes}, besides the fact that the \imp{Higher Planes} are not known to form \imp{Rifts} within the \imp{Mortal Realm}, and nobody has yet established a \imp{Portal} to them either. 
	
	The only way to travel to these \imp{Realms} is therefore by taking a detour to another \imp{Realm}, and hoping that you have come somewhat `closer' to your ultimate destination. Some of the \imp{Higher Planes} require multiple hops to reach, they are so distant from the \imp{Mortal Realm}.
	
	As one gets further away from home, it seems that the concepts and abstract ideals that each realm presents becomes more unusual, more alien - if even detectable. Some of the \imp{Higher Planes} might seem as near-identical copies of the \imp{Mortal Realm}, themselves surrounded by their own copies of \imp{Inner Realms}. Others might embody concepts that are completely alien to human minds that it is impossible to work out what is going on - defying categorisation or study.
	
	The further that one travels in this fashion, the more strange and alien that the world will become - until the beings that you encounter are every bit as terrible and unknowable as the gibbering \imp{Eldritch Horrors}. 
}





\chapter{The Charted Worlds}
\newcommand\subrealm[4]
{
		\realm{\key{#1}\\ {\normalsize #2}}{#3}{#4}
}
Exploratory and scientific expeditions to study the \imp{Lower Planes} have been incredibly limited in their scope (and indeed - entirely limited to the \imp{Lower Planes}, rather than their distant \imp{Higher} companions). 

\section{The \imp{Hells}}

\subrealm{Abyss}{The \imp{Unending Pit} of Terror}{abyss}
{
	Upon first entering \key{Abyss}, one invariably finds oneself alone amidst a vast, sun-scorched desert under a ever-present black sun. 
	
	The desert is utterly flat, featureless and without shade or respite from the heat, with only one feature evident: a vast, circular sinkhole, miles and miles in diameter and so deep it seems to have no end. Creatures of nightmare and shadow stalk the endless desert, attempting capture wayward souls, and drag them back into this pit of dispair. 
	
	Upon reaching the lip of the pit from which \imp{Abyss} takes its name, you may peer down to see thousands - millions - of doors etched into the rockface, with spiralling staircases creeping around the edge and spindly walkways and bridges spanning miles-long distances across the hellish chasm. Endless, terrified, soul-wrenching screams echo helplessly across the vast expanse.
	
	Each door bears a single name inscribed upon it, in a language non can read, but all can understand, and which sends chills down your spine and sets terror deep into your bones.
	
	For this is the true nature of \imp{Abyss}, the Realm of Terror and Fear: behind every door lies a room containing the True Fear of the poor soul named upon the door. Be it an infinite maze, a posse of evil clowns, or an ocean populated by bloodthirsty sharks - if you are unlucky enough to enter the door containing your own name, you suffer a \imp{terror} so deep that you cannot escape, and you are forced to relive your nightmares again and again. 
	
	If you somehow manage to conquer your fears and escape, or your allies are able to rescue you, a legion of nightmarish shadows will emerge and pursue you, doing everything in their power to drag you back into your Room, to suffer in eternity. 
}


\subrealm{Hades}{The \imp{Necrotic Torment} of the Dead and Undying }{hades}
{
	%Whilst death is a natural part of life, \key{Hades} is not a \imp{Realm} within the \imp{Primal Expanse} for a very good reason. 
	\imp{Albus Dumbledore}, in his final set of writings, was insistent that death should not be seen as a negative thing - just a part of the `next great adventure'. It would seem natural, therefore, that the \imp{Realm} of Death should be located upon the \imp{Primal Expanse}, those who have been to \key{Hades}, however, would have to disagree.
	
	\key{Hades} does not merely embody the passing of life: instead it is the realm of gruesome, pointless and violent death. It is also the source of the necrotic energy which animates \imp{undead} atrocities across the multiverse.   
	
	Like the \imp{astral plane}, \imp{Hades} appears as a mimicry of the \imp{Mortal World}, albeit with a few alterations. The landscape is dotted with bomb-craters, bubonic plague pits, collapsed buildings and nuclear winter. Every single grotesque form of death is represented, somehow, in the environment, in a violent, deadly parody of the living world. Sites of large amounts of violent death within the \imp{Mortal Realm} - such as battlefields or natural disasters - are hotspots of powerful necrotic energies.  
	

	Populated entirely by ghostly apparations, gruesome echoes of the living. No one is quite sure what causes a soul to be left in \imp{Hades}, rather than `passing on', though there has been speculation that some souls fear \imp{Death} to such a great extent that they attempt to hold on to the \imp{mortal realm}. Those lucky few who succeed are the ghosts that wizardkind are aware of - the vast majority of souls, however, fail fail to hold on, and are instead left stranded in \imp{Hades}. It has also been suggested that souls snared by \imp{Demonic} entities find their way to \imp{Hades} as well.

	The living cannot spend much time in Hades, as the aura of death and decay seeps into their bones, and seeks to turn them into one of the ghouls that haunts its shattered landscape. 

}

 \subrealm{Tartarus}{The \imp{Twisted Maze} of Torture and Pain}{tartarus}
{
	The home of beings that truly enjoy causing {\it pain} on other living beings, Tartarus is perhaps the most unpleasant plane for a mortal to visit. 
	
	Tartarus appears as a neverending maze, with corridors dripping with blood and skeletons of previous victims. The demonic residents of Tartarus move freely through the walls, hunting their prey. If they catch their them, they torture their victims for as long as possible. Advancement through their terrifying society is achieved by inventive new torture methods, particularly excrutiating torture, or for keeping a victim alive longer than expected.
	
	If you find yourself in Tartarus, the general advice is to leave as quickly as possible. 
}

\section{The \imp{Heavens}}

\subrealm{Elysium}{The \imp{Silver City} of Infinite Blessings}{elysium}
{
	
	\key{Elysium} is as close to the Christian \imp{heaven} as has yet been discovered. A beautiful, verdant and agrarian paradise of rolling green hills, fields of flowers in bloom, and orchards overflowing with bountiful harvest. 
	
	The weather is always perfect - never too hot, and never too cold, and the air is suffused with a dreamy scent which evokes feelings of comfort and love. Positive energy and magic surges within you, making you feel like you can accomplish anything you set your mind to, and whilst you remain in \imp{Elysium}, you will be the recipient of unusually good luck (unless, of course, some bad luck would bring you joy and happiness).
	
	Far in the distance, immense yet seemingly not impacting the surrouding environment, lies the \key{Silver City}, the home of the \imp{Angels}, powerful \imp{Celestial} creatures which quest across the \imp{Realms} to further the goals of the good, and to vanquish those who would perform evil deeds. 
	
	The city itself is constructed out of gleaming silver and shining marble, and glows and sparkles like a second sun. The streets are clean and hum with positive energy, and walking through the city takes you past cosy libraries containing the knowledge of ages, relaxing verandas containing the most exquisite views in all reality, aqueducts bearing sweet, crystal-clear water, statues carved out of solid diamond, paintings composed out of solid light, and simple street performers enacting feats of magic never seen before on earth. 
	
	The city itself seems to be infinite in size (despite taking only a few minutes to walk the perimiter), and though it is almost impossible to get lost, it is also impossible to explore it in its entirety. As such, no one has been able to determine who rules the \imp{Silver City}, and despite the clearly heirarchical nature of \imp{Angelic} society, who or what is giving out orders remains undertermined. 
}


\subrealm{Nirvana}{The \imp{Blissful Peace} of Enlightenment}{nirvana}
{
	Nirvana is an alien landscape to those who first arrive -- it is seemingly and endless white expanse, with no up or down, and no floor. Individuals move simply by willing themselves in a certain direction. The entire domain is suffused with an aura of complete contentment. All desire and anger are stripped from your body, leaving you completely at peace with your place in the universe. 
	
	Those who spend time in Nirvana, however, claim that the whiteness is not perfectly uniform, and that they can see shapes within it. After a significant time, individuals believe that they can make out entire cities, floating in the endless expanse. Eventually, they themselves begin to merge into the whiteness, until they are one with Nirvana. Even if they leave before this happens, so much of Nirvana has infused into their bones that they are incapable of aggression or violence. 
	
	When it was first discovered, Nirvana was proposed as a humane alternative to the wizarding prison of Azkaban, as it removed the threat of further violence completely. However, a combination of a desire for punishment and the question mark of what {\it exactly} happens when they merge with Nirvana meant that Azkaban was retained. 
}

\section{The \imp{Daedal Domains}}

On the \imp{Mortal Realm}, we are used (even if not in these terms) to the increase in \imp{entropy} over time: things tend towards chaos, unless something intervenes to prevent this progress (something which is taken to its extreme on the \imp{Primal Expanse}). The \imp{Daedal Domains}, however, do not suffer this particular affliction: order, complexity and nuance are the natural state of being here. 

A book, if left alone on a \imp{Daedal Domain}, will not decay or degrade, its facts will not slowly become dated or wrong - instead its spine might slowly heal from the damage it has suffered, new pages, containing previously unknown information might slowly develop over decades. So too will an empty field slowly become organised, cities and towns springing up out of nothingness - naturally becoming more advanced and complex as time passes. 



\subrealm{Machina}{The \imp{Clockwork City} of Order}{machina}
{
	In Machina, everything is always in its correct place, for Machina is the Plane of Order, where chaos and randomness are abhored and reviled. Over the millenia, the denizens of Machina have constructed enormous machines that enable them to control every aspect of reality down to the microsecond. The sun always rises at the same time every day, every coin toss lands on the same side, and the same events occur every single day. 
	
	Fearing the chaos inherent in biological systems, the denizens of Machina have also gradually replaced their organic components, until they are almost entirely mechanical in nature. The great cities that dot the moulded landsape -- tracing out perfectly tesselating grids -- are split into three sectors, depending on the modifications that the denizens have made to their bodies, and hence their preferred method of keeping order: clockwork, electronics and magic. 
	
	It is said that the first wizard to create a Golem learned the technique from the inhabitants of Machina.
}	

\subrealm{Scholomancia}{The \imp{Perpetual Library} of Endless, Hidden Knowledge}{scholomancia}
{
	\key{Scholomancia} is probably the smallest of the main \imp{Lower Planes}, consisting as it does of a single wood-panelled reading room about 15 metres by 25 metres in size, lined with bookshelves stocked with ancient tomes. Comfortable leather furniture dots the rest of the room, which has a single inhabitant; the \imp{Librarian}. 
	
	It is rumoured that, despite its small size, the bookshelves in Scholomancia contain every book ever written (and some that weren't), and that the four small walls of \imp{Scholomancia} contain a true and accurate record of every event across the multiverse. Of course, this makes actually finding the book you need something of a challenge - especially as most of the books are written in ancient and forgotten languages. Many a scholar has spent their entire life searching a single shelf on \imp{Scholomancia}. 
	
	If one is willing to make a deal with the \imp{Librarian}, however, this enigmatic figure will trade secrets and information - if it is judged to be of sufficient worth - for access to the knowledge you seek. 
	
	It is intruiging, therefore, that the only information which apparently cannot be found within the tomes of \imp{Scholomancia} regards the nature and origin of its guardian - no one seems to know (and no one seems to have {\it ever} known) who or what this mysterious entity is. Of the scant few conflicting tales and rumours that can be found about the \imp{Librarian} they all agree on one thing: {\it you should not remove a book from the library}.
}


\section{The \imp{Primal Expanse}}

Unlike the other \imp{Lower Planes}, the realms found within the \imp{Primal Expanse} are not {\it entirely} separated and isolated. 

Whether it be the formation of enourmous, centuries-old \imp{rifts} between the planes, or simply the nature of this primal, elemental space: there are large swathes of the \imp{Realms} which bleed into one another, and the ambitious traveller could find themselves tunneling through a volcanic seam within \imp{Gaia}, and find themselves popping out of a magma flow in \imp{Vulcan}. 

Though the \imp{Primal Expanse} is dominated by base concepts such as the natural elements, chaos, life and death - there do exist sapient life, people and even entire civilisations which have evolved there, or made their home in these strange lands. Unlike the \imp{Daedal Domains}, however, the natural state of these realms is one of chaos, disorder and basic existence, and so these civilisations must live their lives ensuring that they do not slip back into this chaos. 

A city left abandoned on the \imp{Mortal Realm} might slowly degrade over centuries - whilst a city on the \imp{Primal Expanse} might suffer the same fate in only a matter of days, being engulfed in flames or swallowed by the Earth. 




\subrealm{Aeolus}{The \imp{Swirling Eddies} of Skies and Storms }{aeolus}
{
	A plane of infinite expanse, filled with swirling air, floating clouds and drifting chunks of earth, \key{Aelous} is the \imp{Realm} associated with the element of Air. 
	
	There is no solid ground to be found in \imp{Aeolus}, the civilisations found within are built upon the floating mountains that dot the skyscape, or perhaps carved out of condensed and harness cloud. These civilisations live a nomadic life as they drift through the endless sky, never fixed in one place. 
	
	Current-charts, which map the airflow and allow you to plot a route through the sky, are the most valued currency in this domain, as are Storm-warnings, for the skies of \imp{Aeolus} are often split apart by vicious storms that can last a century or more. 
	
	\imp{Aeolus} is home to powerful wind-mages, who can calm the skies with a word, or whip up a brisk wind with a wave of their hand. It is said that it was from a lost and stranded wind-mage that humans first learned {\it vente}, the \imp{Gust} spell, allowing them to harness the element of air for themselves.   
}


\subrealm{Eden}{The \imp{Garden of the Circle} of Life and Death}{eden}
{
	A perfect, druidic paradise, \key{Eden} is a single, enormous garden, stretching across hundreds upon hundreds of miles, covering a patchwork of open fields, dense forests, frosted tundra and parched desert. Every single species of plant and animal life which has ever evolved across the multiverse can be found living in perfect balance in \imp{Eden}, plant and fungus, hunter and prey -- the \imp{circle of life} made manifest, for all of eternity. 
	
	No artificial structure can be built in Eden (even attempting do so is almost impossible, and if you do succeed, a dinosaur will inevitably wander by and crush it with their tail) so no true civilisations are found within. The denizens of this realm -- known as the \imp{Gardeners}, a mishmash of species who have found their home here -- are instead nomadic: tending to the wildlife, curing the sick and resolving conflicts between various beasts and plants, holding the \imp{circle} to be holy and paramount. In return for their aid, the flora and fauna of this realm reward their caretakers willingly with fruit and wool, shelter and sustenance. 
	
	Though it might seem idyllic, remember that death is also a part of the \imp{cycle}. Powerful predators, from the present and past of every \imp{Realm} stalk the lands, plants exude potent toxins and fungal spores can suffocate your lungs. 
}


\subrealm{Hyperborea}{The \imp{Frozen Expanse} of Ice and Snow}{hyperborea}
{
A land of endless glaciers and towering crystal-clear castles, Hyperborea is the Elemental Plane of Ice. Due to the freezing temperatures, the Hyperborean species tend to be much larger than their counterparts in other dimensions, to best preserve the heat. They also tend to be fiercly tribal -- gathering together for warmth, but deeply fearful of outsiders. 

The landscape of Hyperborea is sporadic, with vast featureless plains, interspersed with enormous mountain ranges, and fields of icebergs floating on highly-salted oceans.

\subrealm{T\'ir Na N\'og}{The \imp{Radiant Gardens} of Light and Aurorae}{radiantgardens}
{
	The radiant gardens are a plane of light
}



\subrealm{Vulcan}{The \imp{Burning Wilderness} of Fire and Ash}{vulcan}
{
Visually, Vulcan most resembles typical depictions of the Christian Hell, with enormous pools of lava, gouts of fire twenty feet high, and patrolled by demons with pools of flame for eyes. However, this domain is simply the Plane associated with Elemental Fire, not with righteous torture of the evil.

Outside of the volcano-top castles and their pools of lava, the land is covered in a fertile ash, and populated by ruby-red trees that can only distribute their seeds when the tree is consumed by fire. Diverse species of dragon, from tiny lizard-like creatures to formidable goliaths patrol the skys. The fire of this realm serves not simply to destroy, but to cleanse and refresh and as such, though Vulcan is quite alien to us mortals, it has been home to several thriving and prosperous civilisations.
}


%~ {\bf Planemeld Effect:} when melded with the mortal plane, Machina imposes order on the region, forcing all beings into their true form. Illusions shatter, transfiguration spells fail and astral effects are nullified. 

%~ \subsection{Pand{\ae}monium: The Plane of Chaos}

%~ As the name suggests, Pand{\ae}monium is a realm of pure unadulterated chaos, a whirling soup of matter, energy and magic. 

%~ A calm ocean sits metres away from a typhoon, which warps into a lake freezing in a bed of lava. Fragments of stable landscapes drift through the chaotic world, being destroyed and reformed by the whirling chaos that infuses this dimension. Even gravity is not a constant, sometimes normal, sometimes twice the usual strength, sometimes even negative. 

%~ Pand{\ae}monium, however, will respond to an individual imposing their will on it. A simple individual may be able to impose normalcy on a region just large enough to prevent their atoms from shredding as the laws of physics morph. A particularly strong-willed individual, however, can impose order amongst the chaos -- potentially for many dozens of metres, creating a safe haven for themselves. As soon as their will is broken, however, Pand{\ae}monium will reclaim the land into its everlasting chaos. 

%~ {\bf Planemeld Effect:} when melded with the mortal plane, Pand{\ae}monium forces all beings in the region to pass a SPR(endurance) Resist check (DV 10), or be {\it True Shapeshift}-ed into a random animal for 1 minute. 

%~
%~ {\bf Planemeld Effect:} when melded with the mortal plane, Tartarus Causes all beings to suffer as if the {\it Incomprehensible Torture} spell had been cast on them with 2PP. 
%~ \subsection{Valhalla: The Plane of Bravery}

%~ Viking mythology tells that at the heart of Asgard, lies the great Mead Hall of Heroes; Valhalla. It is from this myth that the Plane of Bravery gets its name. Societies in Valhalla hold bravery and conquest up as the mightiest virtue, and fear to be the greatest weakness. At the heart of Valhalla, lies a stone henge -- a series of portals to other plains. As a rite of passage to be considered an adult, every individual must pass through a random portal, and bring back some plunder. The greater the plunder, the more respected in society that that individual is. 

%~ As a result of this somewhat primitive plunder-centric economy, the civilisations of Valhalla are not technologically advanced, and mostly resemble the Middle Ages of the Mortal World, albeit studded with advanced technology and magics that have been stolen from other planes. 

%~ Most of the great adventures in the multiverse begin their story in Valhalla.
