\chapter{Hogwarts}

\key{Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry} is the centre of magical education for the British Isles - all magically-capable students born in the UK or Ireland are automatically enrolled, and are expected to attend. 

Established in the 10th century by the \imp{Four Founders} and alliteration afficionados: \key{Godric Gryffindor}, \key{Helena Hufflepuff}, \key{Rowena Ravenclaw} and \key{Salazar Slytherin}, the school is situated in \imp{Hogwarts Castle}, a purpose-built magical keep surrounded by a mysterious and ancient magical forest. The precise location of \imp{Hogwarts Castle} is something of a secret - the castle is protected by some of the most powerful defensive charms outside of \imp{Gringotts} bank - which render it \imp{unplottable} and unfindable by all but those who deserve to find it. 

\key{Hogwart} is considered one of the greatest institutions in the magical world, and certainly the finest educational institude - a title long sought after by the other prominent schools: \imp{Ilvermory} in the US, \imp{Beauxbatons} in France and \imp{Durmstrang} in North-Eastern Europe. 

The castle itself is enormous and labyrinthian - there are hidden rooms, secret passages and magical creatures hiding around every corner, which often leads students into great trouble, great mischeif, great adventure - or some combination of all three. The castle lies within expansive grounds - the vast majority of which are occupied by the seemingly endless \imp{Forbidden Forest}, which is inhabited by \imp{Centaurs}, \imp{Acromantula} and all manner of magical creatures - there have even been the occaisional \imp{Unicorns} sighted. 
 
\imp{Hogwarts} is a place of endless potential, mystery and adventure, and so is the primary setting for most adventures within the magical world - or at least the place where the adventures {\it start}.

\section{Students \& School System}

For most of \imp{Hogwarts} history, it has acted as a \imp{Secondary School}, in the parlance of the British Education system - educating students from the age of 11 to 18, through seven years of study. Along the way they study for two major academic milestones - \imp{Ordinary Wizarding Levels} (O.W.Ls) and the \imp{Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests} (N.E.W.T.s) which act as the baseline academic qualifications for their further carer. 



From a RPG perspective, roleplaying as 11 year olds might not be the most appealing prospect - and can certainly the limit the kinds of adventures and storylines you can concoct. 

In order to provide a world where students can have a bit more self-reliance, independence and danger - without feeling like you're going to be killing pre-teens - the following variant rule can be adopted:  

\subsubsection{Optional Rule: Higher Education}

Following the fallout of the \imp{Second Wizarding War}, the Wizarding World entered into a period of deep introspection, asking themselves how they could prevent another such catastrophe from occuring. 

One solution that was floated was to reduce the disparity between the \imp{Muggle World} and the \imp{Wizarding World} - rather than separating students from their non-magical peers at 11, they would remain in school with them until the end of the standard muggle education system - at which point (so the theory goes) they would be mature enough to empathise with muggles, and be able to go on to begin their magical education at \imp{Hogwarts} with a more rounded understanding of the world around them. 

In this scenario, \imp{Hogwarts} acts more akin to a Sixth Form or a University rather than a secondary school (and would also help explain why \imp{Hogwarts} has no mathematics or english classes - or even sex education - necessary to provide basic life skills).

Of course, this solution has been beset with problems - particularly from some of the more obnoxious \imp{pureblood} families, who have either elected to homeschool their children or set up `muggle schools' populated entirely by wizarding children, in order to avoid the integration efforts that this system was put in place to provide.
