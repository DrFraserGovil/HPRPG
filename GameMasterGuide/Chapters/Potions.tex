\chapter{Potions \& Ingredients}	

As per the Core Rulebook, potion mixing occurs when a player places a number of alchemical ingredients into a cauldron, and performs a 1d20 INT (arcane) check, along with any related bonuses.

The check difficulty, and the resulting potion effects are determined by the ingredients that they place into the cauldron.

Each ingredient has up to 4 individual effects, each with an associated strength (which may be negative). Mixing ingredients with effects in common results in more powerful potions with that effect. 

Because of this setup, there are many different ways to mix any given potion -- so a strict recipe is not necessary. Players may find that experimentation and intuition will help them craft powerful potions. However, they may wish to learn some concrete recipes, so some basic recipes are provided below:


\section{Determining the Effects of a Potion}

There are two ways to determine the effects of a potion -- either the GM can manually observe any cross-matches in the noted effects of the selected ingredients, and then use GM fiat to decide what the most logical outcome of the potion should be.  Alternatively, a python script, \verb|mixer.py| has been provided that calculates this for you, taking into account the dice roll and any catalysts in the mixture. To load \verb|mixer|, open a python terminal and navigate to the directory in which \verb|mixer.py| is saved. Then type:
\begin{verbatim}
	import mixer as mix
\end{verbatim}
This loads in the \verb|mixer| module into the current python environment. You may then call the mixing command by typing:
\begin{verbatim}
	mix.potion( [id1,id2,...], check)
\end{verbatim}
The square brackets contain an array (separated by commas) of the ID numbers of the ingredients that are being mixed. Between 2 and 5 non-repeated ingredients may be added. \verb|check| is a positive integer that represents the total potion-making check (including bonuses and proficiencies). For example, to mix a Wiggenweld potion with a roll of 16 and an INT bonus of 2, we would type:

\def\wiggenID{112}
\def\dittanID{27}
\def\horkID{54}
\begin{verbatim}
	>>> mix.potion([112,27,54],18)
=============================================================================================
Mixing potion with ingredients:  Wiggentree Bark,  Dittany,  Horklump Juice,  with a roll of 18

   The drinker of the potion:
                 + recovers 30 HP points
=============================================================================================
\end{verbatim}

\verb|mixer| also takes into account any particularly good or bad rolls. If you roll below the combined mixing difficulty of the ingredients, it starts adding in random bad effects. These bad effects often affect the brewer of the potion, rather than effects in the potion itself. For example, if we had rolled only a 4 for the Wiggenweld potion, we would find:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> mix.potion([112,27,54],6)
===============================================================================================
Mixing potion with ingredients:  Wiggentree Bark,  Dittany,  Horklump Juice,  with a roll of 6

   The brewer of the potion:
        +Becomes addicted to this potion. Permanent -1 INT decrease for every day that potion is not consumed.
   The drinker of the potion:
        + recovers 12 HP points
================================================================================================
\end{verbatim}
