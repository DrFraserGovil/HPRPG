\chapter{Potions \& Ingredients}	

As per the Core Rulebook, potion mixing occurs when a player places a number of alchemical ingredients into a cauldron, and performs a 1d20 INT (arcane) check, along with any related bonuses.

The check difficulty, and the resulting potion effects are determined by the ingredients that they place into the cauldron.

Each ingredient has up to 4 individual effects, each with an associated strength (which may be negative). Mixing ingredients with effects in common results in more powerful potions with that effect. 

Because of this setup, there are many different ways to mix any given potion \minus{}\minus{} so a strict recipe is not necessary. Players may find that experimentation and intuition will help them craft powerful potions. However, they may wish to learn some concrete recipes, so some basic recipes are provided below:
