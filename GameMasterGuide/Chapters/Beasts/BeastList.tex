\species{Acromantula}
{
	The acromantula are an incredibly rare \minus{} and incredibly dangerous \minus{} species of gigantic\comma{} intelligent spiders. Found mainly in dense forests\comma{} where they weave their web\minus{}covered nests\comma{} they only occaisionally go out to hunt\comma{} preferring instead to let their prey come to them. 

Hatching from eggs the size of rugby balls\comma{} the oldest specimens have legspans in excess of 10 metres. Their equally enormous fangs contain a potent venom. The speed\comma{} strength and venom\comma{} however\comma{} is not what makes the Acromantula a truly awful foe. Rather\comma{} their greatest weapon is their formiddable intellect\comma{} which allows them to outthink even the greatest wizards. 

\ability{Elaborate Lairs}{A spider\apos{}s central tenet is patience: waiting for prey to come ot you. Acromantula are no different\comma{} though they work on a slightly different scale. Over their multi\minus{}decade\minus{}long lifespan\comma{} a Patriarch will build an enormous\comma{} complex labyrinth of webs and forest\comma{} in order to ensnare their unsuspecting prey}

\ability{Talking Spiders:}{Acromantula have the ability to speak the spider tongue\comma{} to command their legions of arachnid followers. As they age and their minds continue to develop\comma{} they even gain the ability to understand and eventually speak in human tongues.}

\ability{Keen Sight}{In addition to their web\minus{}enhanced senses\comma{} the 8 compound eyes of the acromantula allow them to see in incredible detail\comma{} even in dim light}

\ability{Webspinners}{As members of the spider family\comma{} all Acromantula have an affinity for spinning webs\comma{} and using them to sense and then ensnare their prey.}
