\species{Acromantula}
{
	The acromantula are an incredibly rare \minus{} and incredibly dangerous \minus{} species of gigantic\comma{} intelligent spiders. Found mainly in dense forests\comma{} where they weave their web\minus{}covered nests\comma{} they only occaisionally go out to hunt\comma{} preferring instead to let their prey come to them. 

Hatching from eggs the size of rugby balls\comma{} the oldest specimens have legspans in excess of 10 metres. Their equally enormous fangs contain a potent venom. The speed\comma{} strength and venom\comma{} however\comma{} is not what makes the Acromantula a truly awful foe. Rather\comma{} their greatest weapon is their formiddable intellect\comma{} which allows them to outthink even the greatest wizards. 

\ability{Elaborate Lairs}{A spider\apos{}s central tenet is patience: waiting for prey to come ot you. Acromantula are no different\comma{} though they work on a slightly different scale. Over their multi\minus{}decade\minus{}long lifespan\comma{} a Patriarch will build an enormous\comma{} complex labyrinth of webs and forest\comma{} in order to ensnare their unsuspecting prey}

\ability{Talking Spiders:}{Acromantula have the ability to speak the spider tongue\comma{} to command their legions of arachnid followers. As they age and their minds continue to develop\comma{} they even gain the ability to understand and eventually speak in human tongues.}

\ability{Keen Sight}{In addition to their web\minus{}enhanced senses\comma{} the 8 compound eyes of the acromantula allow them to see in incredible detail\comma{} even in dim light}

\ability{Webspinners}{As members of the spider family\comma{} all Acromantula have an affinity for spinning webs\comma{} and using them to sense and then ensnare their prey.}

\species{Angels}
{
	Angels are powerful\comma{} beautiful Celestial creatures\comma{} denizens of Elysium\comma{} one of the Higher Planes\comma{} though they can be found throughout the multiverse. Often perceived as powerful agents of Deities\comma{} servants of benevolent gods\comma{} it is actually unknown who or what provides these powerful creatures with their deeper purpose. 

\ability{Benevolent Fury}{Almost universally pure of heart and intrinsically ethical and good\comma{} Angels are representative of everything full of light and life in the universe. Angels will never compromise their core beliefs. They are not\comma{} however\comma{} pacifists. Angels are great and pwoerful warriors\comma{} and will strike down their enemies in the name of protecting those who cannot protect themselves.}

\ability{Angelic Host}{The Angelic society is known as the {\it Angelic Host}\comma{} a powerful seemingly omniscient society which dwells almost entirely in the Silver City found at the centre of Elysium. This society is highly structured and hierarchical\comma{} with angels being created to fill specific niches within each echelon of society. Each Angel derives their powers from their position within the angelic hierarchy\comma{} with the highest tiers wielding terrifying amounts of power.}

\ability{Holy Crusades}{Angels only leave the Silver City on two conditions\comma{} the most common of which is being directed on a holy quest by one of their superiors. Most Angels met outside of Elysium are conducting such a quest. The difficulty of the quest depends on the ranking of the angel in question: a cherubim might be sent out to conduct a blessing\comma{} or deliver a message\comma{} whilst a quest which calls for an Archangel to be sent would be a truly dire universe\minus{}ending scenario. }

\ability{Fallen Angel}{The other condition under which an Angel is refused entry into the Silver City is if they have {\it fallen}. Though Angels will never compromise their core beliefs\comma{} and are almost inherently good in nature it is possible for them to fall victim to their own pride and hubris. If this happens\comma{} an angel may act against the wishes of the Host\comma{} or inadvertently perform some great act of evil. 

If this happens\comma{} the Host will disavow them\comma{} and cast them out. Without the purpose granted to them by the rigid structure of Angelic society\comma{} many such fallen angels go entirely mad. Others sink into a deep\comma{} vengeful fury and declare war on the Host\comma{} whilst others are believed to undergo a transformation\comma{} becoming powerful demonic creatures. }

\species{Elf}
{
	Modern muggle culture frequently imagines Elves to be superhuman\comma{} immortal and otherworldly creatures – outwardly appearing as impossibly beautiful humans and wielding immense\comma{} primal magic. This is primarly due to the influence of the muggle writer Tolkein (who was himself a squib). In reality\comma{} elves are much closer to those envisaged in medieval Germanic mythology – small\comma{} impish tricksters. 

Though they have a love for tricks and fun\comma{} the most common form of elf throughout history\comma{} the {\it Br{\'u}nb{\'a}su}\comma{} or {\it Common Brownie} often helped humans by performing small chores for them. In one of the more shameful acts of wizarding history\comma{} the Br{\'u}nb{\'a}su were then systematically enslaved and brainwashed into eternal servitude\comma{} leading to the creation of the race of House\minus{}Elves. Witnessing this horrific act of human cruelty\comma{} many of the other elf species retreated into relative obscurity.

\ability{Diminutive Frame}{Almost all species of Elf are tiny in stature – rarely reaching more than 3ft in height – with skinny and spindly arms and legs. They rely on magic for physical acts that their size denies them. }

\ability{Elfin Magics}{Elf magic is unlike any that is understood by humans\comma{} who often look down on it as inferior. Some scholars\comma{} however\comma{} have hypothesised that elfin magic is in fact far superior to wizard magic. It is only due to the elfin spirit and its dislike of organisation and study (and probably helped by wizard oppression) that they have not learned to harness it to its full potential. The most prominent quirk of elfin magic is their ability to ignore even the strongest magical wards and boundaries.}  

\ability{Fond of Trickery}{All elves (except perhaps the brainwashed House Elves) are fond of trickery and fun. They play endless pranks on one another\comma{} delighting in causing small amounts of chaos. Even those who are dedicated to cleaning and tidying play the occassional trick: muggles notice this in the form of missing socks\comma{} or keys never quite being where they were left.}

\ability{Holding Court}{Elven society is chaotic and unorganised. They rarely recognise a leader\comma{} though they sometimes assemble themselves into bands and groups for the purpose of safety. This all changes when one of the Elven Princes summons them to their Seelie Court. Every free\minus{}elf belongs to one of these courts\comma{} which is presided over by one of the more powerful Hulduf{\'o}lk. Court is only summoned in times of great emergency\comma{} such as conflict with another court\comma{} or when a great external threat is detected.}

The \name{} reside within a group of dimensions known as the {\it Seelie Courts}\comma{} which lie close to the Astral realm. Each Seelie Court is a verdant paradise\comma{} populated entirely by elves\comma{} both those species which are found on Earth\comma{} and myriad others.

Each Court is ruled over by an Elf\minus{}Prince\comma{} the most powerful \name{} in the Court\comma{} as well as their advisors and attendants. Typically these offices are all held by other \name{}s\comma{} though rarely you may find a Dun\ae{}lf or V\ae{}ttir who has risen through the ranks of the Court to serve in these lofty positions. 

Even those elves which reside on Earth are (technically) members of a Court\comma{} and must obey the summons from their Prince when it is time for them to attend their Seelie Court\comma{} failure to do so leads to expulsion (or worse). In reality\comma{} however\comma{} the Seelie Courts are rarely called in such a manner and Earthbound elves may not even know that they belong to a Court until the summons arrives. 

The \name{} wield immense and powerful magic\comma{} which they primarily use to cause mischief\comma{} mayhem and to disrupt the plans of the other members of the courts. The most famous conflict between various courts is that between Oberon and Titania\comma{} with the conflict spilling over into the Mortal Plane on more than one occasion\comma{} even making its way into the muggle subconscious. 

On rare occasions a Court can become corrupted by evil – either due to the profane actions of the Prince themselves\comma{} or because of some external corrupting influence such as a Voidic Incursion. A corrupted court is known as an {\it Unseelie Court}\comma{} and is often a source of violence\comma{} conflict and further corruption. 

Though not all \name{}s are Elf\minus{}Princes\comma{} those which are have access to the specified {\it Lair Actions} whilst they remain in their Court.}

\species{Giants}
{
	Giants are very large bipdal beings\comma{} growing up to 8m ($\sim$25ft) in height. Many giants appear to be simply humongous humans\comma{} whilst others have disproportionate features\comma{} such as long arms which drag along the floor\comma{} or oversized heads. Rarer still are those which possess more bestial features\comma{} such as elongated fangs\comma{} thick green hide or snouted noses. There is no known rhyme or reason for how such features arise in the giant genetics\comma{} as members of even close family can vary wildly in their outward appearance. 

What is a constant amongst all giants is their phenomenal strength and their willingness to use it. Wizarding history has recorded bloody inter\minus{}giant wars going back millenia\comma{} and there have been more than several occasions of giants turning their ferocity onto wizardkind\comma{} which has led to a general distrust\comma{} fear and even hatred of the giant clans\comma{} which was only exacerbated when the Northern Clans joined forces with Voldemort during the Wizarding Wars. 

\ability{Organised Society}{Though to wizards the giants appear chaotic\comma{} violent and disorganised\comma{} they possess a highly rigid society within and between clans. The {\bf Gurg} is the warleader\comma{} who rules the clan in all matters related to combat: they decide when to send out raiding and hunting parties and when war is declared. The Gurg is the mightiest warrior in the clan – a new Gurg is chosen by another warrior defeating them in single combat\comma{} often to the death. The {\bf Council of Elders} rules the clan in all other matters\comma{} and resolves internal disputes. Membership of the council is determined by a rudimentary form of democracy in a ritual which predates even Athenian democracy. }

\ability{Intelligent Beings}{Though generally not as intelligent as humans\comma{} giants are significantly more intelligent than mere beasts\comma{} as well as other gigantoid bretheren such as Trolls. They are capable of manufacturing and using armour\comma{} weapons and tools both in battle\comma{} and in every day life. In many ways\comma{} giant technology is similar to human society $\sim$2000 years ago. }

\ability{Prideful}{Though their relative lack of intelligence is well known in the wizarding community\comma{} it is a point of some contention amongst the giants\comma{} who wish to be seen as just as intelligent as the other sapient races. Virtually all negative interactions between giants and humans has arisen because the humans condescended giants\comma{} or otherwise lorded their intelligence over the giants. When dealing with giants\comma{} it is almost always best to restrain the urge to show off – use simple sentences and ideas\comma{} give the giants time and space to think things through and\comma{} most importantly\comma{} not make a big deal out of behaving in this fashion. }

\ability{Resilience}{Full\minus{}blooded Giants are potentially even more resistant to magic than dragons\comma{} requiring exceptionally powerful magic to subdue them. Though their skin appears no more protective than normal humans\comma{} their large size means standard weaponry does not pose much of a threat to them\comma{} though it does irritate them. }

\ability{Magic Appreciation}{Though they cannot wield magic themselves\comma{} giants are aware of magic and find the idea of it fascinating (as long as it is not being used agains them that is). The best way to integrate yourself with a giant is to provide them with a spectactular show of magic\comma{} and gift them a magical device or trinket.}

Mounted atop the antlers are a series of dripping candles\comma{} said to a allow the Soul Devourer to act as a guide throught he inky darkness of the Void\comma{} as they travel to do their master\apos{}s bidding. 

As the arcane experts of the Abyssal Army\comma{} the Soul Devourers\comma{} as their name might suggest\comma{} rely heavily on the power of ritual sacrifices and the corruption and absorption of slain souls\comma{} even using the souls of their slain allies to power their assaults. Their long\comma{} spider\minus{}like hands are continually dripping with thick\comma{} congealed blood which they use in their profane rituals\comma{} and as a powerful weapon. 

Of all of the Abyssal Spawn\comma{} it seems that the Soul Devourers have the most amount of free will\comma{} and will often explicitly communicate that they are allied with their Abyssal Masters out of convenience\comma{} rather than the rabid\comma{} unthinking loyalty expressed by some of the other soldiers in the Profane Masses. 

Whispered rumours in some corners of the Multiverse indicate that some Soul Devourers have even gone rogue\comma{} and attempted to rebel against their masters\comma{} some have even had a degree of success. That the Soul Devourers remain such an integral part of the Abyssal Army indicates that this rebellious streak is in some way beneficial to their masters\comma{} though no one is quite sure why or how this might be.}

A grotesque\comma{} scarred humanoid body is sewn onto a countless mass of tentacles which seem to boil and writhe of their own accord. Standing tall over the immense\comma{} endless battlefield\comma{} it surveys the chaos; planning and strategising. 

With a movement as fast as the eye can see\comma{} the abomination leaps into battle\comma{} dueling hand\minus{}to\minus{}hand with the most powerful servants of the light\comma{} firing bolts of dark arcane energy from a finger\comma{} and screeching orders to the untold legions of the Abyss. 

This is the Wielder\minus{}of\minus{}Night\comma{} the Commander of the Abyssal Legions\comma{} Slayer of Hope\comma{} Destroyer of Worlds\comma{} and the reason that every sane being in the multiverse is afraid of the darkness. 

It is unknown if the Wielder\minus{}of\minus{}Night is a position\comma{} akin to a general\comma{} or if there is only one of them\comma{} a single mighty champion of the Eldritch Horroers\comma{} who has executed their will throughout the eons. Most scholars hope that it is the latter\comma{} for the idea of there being multiple such beings is too horrible to even consider. 

There is only one recorded instance of a Wielder\minus{}of\minus{}Night stepping onto the Mortal Realm\comma{} at the culmination of the final battle of the Cataclysm. Merlin the Great\comma{} the most powerful Wizard who ever lived\comma{} managed to barely survive its onslaught\comma{} until he tricked it into falling through a Rift in time and space\comma{} which he sealed behind it. So harrowing was this experience\comma{} that Merlin refused to talk about it for hundreds of years after the event.}
