%~ \chapter{Introducing the Beastiary}

%~ Over the course of any decent magical adventure, a burgeoning adventurer would expect to encounter dozens and dozens of different types of magical creatures, both as allies to be befriended and helped, and mortal foes to be fought and vanquished. 

%~ As the GM it is your job to provide your players with interesting encounters to investigate, and challenges to overcome. The \imp{Bestiary} is not intended to be a panacea to solve all of these problems: merely one tool out of many.
