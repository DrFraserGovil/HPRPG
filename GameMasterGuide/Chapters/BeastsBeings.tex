\chapter{Beasts, Beings and Other Bad Business}

There are 3 classes of entity in this game: Beasts, Un-life and Sapients. 

Beasts are living beings without intelligence or self awareness, or with such a staggering level of violence and hatred that they cannot interact with other Sapients without imminent danger. Most beasts cannot use magic consciously, but may have innate magical abilities. 

Sapients are those creatures with intelligence, language and society. Mostly humanoids (though with a few exceptions), sapients can often wield magic with intent, unlike the mindless usage of the beasts. All player characters must be sapients. For political reasons, the word {\it Beings} is often used, though Sapients such as Centaurs and the Merpeople object to sharing this category with, for example, the hags, and hence are often classified as {\it beasts}, despite their evidently sapient nature. 

The Un-Life are those beings which cannot truly be called alive, and are often either inert matter brought to some mimicry of life by a spellcaster, or raw manifestations of pure magic. Often thought of as abominations due to creatures such as Dementors and Inferi, the Un-Life are often incredibly alien and hard to understand.

The Acromantula is carnivorous and prefers large prey. It spins domeshaped webs upon the ground. Despite its near-human intellect the Acromantula is untrainable and highly dangerous to wizard and Muggle alike.}{ {25}{6}{10/13/15}{6}{18/20/24}{2}{15}{8} }{{Tropical  Rainforest}{Legspan}{4m}}{ {35 / 40 / 50}{Hard carapace on  abdomen, strength 10.} }{ {Bite: 6 / 10 / 15 + 1 d10 (piercing)}{None} }{ {Envenom (fangs, see {\it Sudden Death} potion for effect); Ensnare (2 turns, melee); Can talk;}{Exposed cephalothorax.}{50\% Magic Resistance;} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Ashwinder}{Fire Snake}}{The Ashwinder is created when a magical fire is allowed to burn unchecked for too long. A thin, pale-grey serpent with glowing red eyes, it will rise from the embers of an unsupervised fire and slither away into the shadows of the dwelling in which it finds itself, leaving an ashy trail behind it. Incredibly delicate, the Ashwinder lives for only an hour and during that time seeks a dark and secluded spot in which to lay its eggs, after which it will collapse into dust.}{ {16}{5}{3}{3}{9}{5}{5}{0} }{{Magical Fires}{Length}{30cm}}{ {2 / 3 / 4}{None} }{ {Burn: 1d4 (fire, mild)}{Fire-spit: 1d6/8/10 (range 2m, fire damage: mild)} }{ {Ignite objects (range 1m);}{Water contact does 1d6 damage}{100\% Fire Resistance;} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Augrey}{Weather Forecasting Bird}}{A thin and mournfullooking bird, somewhat like a small and underfed vulture in appearance, the Augurey is greenish black. It is intensely shy, nests in bramble and thorn, eats large insects and fairies, flies only in heavy rain, and otherwise remains hidden in its tear-shaped nest. The Augurey has a distinctive low and throbbing cry, which was once believed to foretell death, research eventually revealed, however, that the Augurey merely sings at the approach of rain.}{ {2}{5}{14/16/20}{10}{8}{15}{2}{0} }{{Britain and Ireland}{Wingspan}{90cm}}{ {8}{None} }{ {Peck:  2 + 1d4 / 6 / 8 (piercing)}{None} }{ {Can sense changes in weather; ATH x10  in flight}{}{} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Basilisk}{Giant Gorgon-Snake}}{The Basilisk is a brilliant green serpent that may reach up to fifty feet in length. The male has a scarlet plume upon its head. It has exceptionally venomous fangs but its most dangerous means of attack is the gaze of its large yellow eyes. Anyone looking directly into these will suffer instant death.}{ {16}{2}{17}{1}{1}{1}{20/21/22}{8/9/10} }{{Artificial, not found in nature}{Length}{20m}}{ {35 / 45 / 60}{Thick skin, strength 8.} }{ {Bite: 10 + 2d6 / 8 / 10  (piercing) \\ Tail Whip: 1d8 (bludegeoning)}{None} }{ {Gorgon stare (direct view: death, indirect: paralysis); Envenom (Fangs, Severe Poison status, 1d20 damage per turn)}{Exposed eyes and mouth}{70\% Magic Resistance;} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Bicorn}{Two-Horned Unicorn}}{The Bicorn is an equine creature similar to a unicorn and possessed of the same magical abilities. The only visible difference between the two is the Bicorn's two horns which grow one above the other on their heads. Bicorns are incredibly rare and the magic of their horns are even greater than that of a unicorn: and angering a bicorn is said to bring about nothing but bad luck.}{ {16/17/18}{4}{9}{10}{10}{10}{3}{3} }{{Indian Forests}{Length}{2m}}{ {14}{None.} }{ {Impale:  2d6 / 8 / 10 (piercing)}{None} }{ {Gore gives `Broken Wandï¿½ for 5 turns}{}{} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Billywig}{Halluncinogenic Helicopter Insect}}{The Billywig is an insect native to Australia. It is around half an inch long and a vivid sapphire blue, although its speed is such that it is rarely noticed by Muggles and often not by wizards until they have been stung. The Billywig{\apos}s wings are attached to the top of its head and are rotated very fast so that it spins as it flies. At the bottom of the body is a long thin sting. Those who have been stung by a Billywig suffer giddiness followed by levitation.}{ {15/17/19}{1}{2}{1}{1}{3}{1}{0} }{{Austrailia}{Height}{3cm}}{ {3}{None} }{ {Sting: 1d4 (piercing)}{None} }{ {Envenom (euphoria, paralysis and levitation);}{}{} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Blast-Ended Skrewt}{Fire-Breathing Scorpions}}{Hybrid creatures bred from the unholy union of a manticore and a fire crab. The Blast-Ended Skrewt resemble giant, slimy scorpions with tails (and stingers) at both ends. The creatures are also able to shoot blasts of fire from either end, which they use to their advantage when hunting prey. Very difficult to harm, due to their strong shells, these creatures are not to be trifled with.}{ {7}{1}{4}{1}{2}{1}{10}{1} }{{Artificial, not found in nature}{Length}{2m}}{ {10}{Hard shell covers entire upper body, stength 25.

It is immensely difficult to spot, being small (maximum eight inches in height) and apparently made of bark and twigs with two small brown eyes. The Bowtruckle, which eats insects, is a peaceable and intensely shy creature but if the tree in which it lives is threatened, it has been known to leap down and gouge at their eyes of the wrongdoer with its long, sharp fingers. An offering of woodlice will placate the Bowtruckle long enough to let a witch or wizard remove wand-wood from its tree.}{ {4}{13/14/15}{3}{3}{6}{8}{2}{0} }{{Forests of Northern Europe}{Height}{15cm}}{ {5 / 6 / 7}{None} }{ {Scratch: 1d4 (slashing)}{None} }{ {Camouflage (in foliage);}{200\% Fire Damage}{} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Bundimun}{Living Fungus}}{Skilled at creeping under floorboards and behind skirting boards, bundimun infest houses. The presence of a Bundimun is usually announced by a foul stench of decay. The Bundimun oozes a secretion which rots away the very foundations of the dwelling in which it is found. The Bundimun at rest resembles a patch of greenish fungus with eyes, though when alarmed it will scuttle away on its 6 numerous spindly legs. It feeds on dirt.}{ {2}{1}{1}{1}{1}{1}{1}{0} }{{Worldwide}{Width}{20cm}}{ {10 / 12 / 15}{None.} }{ {Ooze: 1d4 / 6 / 8 (poison)}{Toxic Spore: 1d6 / 8 / 12} }{ {Toxic skin (contact, 1d4  poison damage per turn)}{}{} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Chimera}{Vicious Multi-Headed Hybrid}}{The Chimeria is a rare greek monster which appears as crossbreed of a lion, a goat, a dragon, with three heads. All three heads act independently, and the dragon head can breath fire, some species (potentially the males, though none who have attempted to check the gender have survived) have a fourth head ï¿½ that of a snake ï¿½ as a tail. An extremely vicious and bloodthirsty animal, there is only one known instance of a wizard slaying a chimera -- and he died from exhaustion immediately afterwards.}{ {15/17/20}{2}{30}{1}{20}{2}{25}{9/11/13} }{{Greece}{Length}{4m}}{ {70 / 80 / 100}{Magical skin, strength 25} }{ {Bite:  3d 8 / 10 / 20  (piercing)}{Fire Breath: 1d 8 / 10 / 12 (fire, mild)} }{ {Flight (prolonged);}{}{100\% Magic Resistance (Below Expert)} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Chizpurfle}{Magical Parasite}}{Chizpurfles are small parasites up to a twentieth of an inch high, crablike in appearance, with large fangs. They are attracted by magic and may infest the fur and feathers of such creatures as Crups and Augureys. They will also enter wizard dwellings and attack magical objects such as wands, gradually gnawing their way through to the magical core, or else settle in dirty cauldrons, where they will gorge upon any lingering drops of potion, or even attack muggle electronics.}{ {6}{2}{4}{1}{2}{2}{1}{0} }{{Worldwide}{Length}{10 mm}}{ {1}{None} }{ {Bite: 1d4 (piercing)}{None} }{ {Ambient Absorb (releases unpredictably)}{}{} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Cockatrice}{Failed Basilisk}}{A cockatrice is the result of a failed attempt at the creation of a basilisk, retaining the characteristics of the chicken from the egg it hatched from: resembling a stunted basilisk, with a chicken{\apos}s head.  he gaze of a cockatrice is not deadly like a basilisk{\apos}s, but it does cause a severe paralysis. The cockatrice is far quicker than a basilisk, and there have been recordings of a cockatrice being able to kill an adolescent basilisk, because of its superior agility and intelligence.}{ {20/22/24}{7}{14}{2}{5}{5}{14}{6} }{{Artificial, not found in nature}{Length}{10m}}{ {25 / 35 / 40}{Thick skin, strength 6.

The Demiguise is a peaceful herbivorous beast, something like a graceful ape in appearance, with large, black, doleful eyes more often than not hidden by its hair. The whole body is covered with long, fine, silky, silvery hair. Demiguise pelts are highly valued as the hair may be spun into Invisibility Cloaks.}{ {9}{9}{8}{4}{11}{12}{3}{0} }{{Far East}{Height}{40cm}}{ {7 / 8 / 9}{None} }{ {Scratch: 1d4  (slashing) \\ Bite 1d6 + 1 / 2 / 3 (piercing)}{None} }{ {Invisibility (at will)}{}{} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Diricawl}{Teleporting Bird}}{A plump-bodied, fluffyfeathered, flightless bird, the Diricawl is remarkable for its method of escaping danger. It can vanish in a puff of feathers and reappear elsewhere. Interestingly, Muggles were once fully aware of the existence of the Diricawl, though they knew it by the name of {\it dodo.}}{ {3}{2}{5}{3}{4}{5}{2}{0} }{{Worldwide}{Wingspan}{10cm}}{ {4 / 5 / 10}{None} }{ {Peck: 1d4 + 1 / 2 / 3 (piercing)}{None} }{ {Apparate (range: 2 / 4 / 6m );  ATH + FIN x10 when in air}{}{} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Doxy}{Beetle Fairy}}{The Doxy is often mistaken for a fairy (see page 16) though it is a quite separate species. Like the fairy, it has a minute human form, though in the Doxy{\apos}s case this is covered in thick black hair and has an extra pair of arms and legs. The Doxy{\apos}s wings are thick, curved, and shiny, much like a beetle{\apos}s. Doxies have double rows of sharp, venomous teeth. An antidote should be taken if bitten.}{ {6}{7}{4}{2}{3}{2}{4}{3} }{{Northern Europe and North America}{Height}{3cm}}{ {4 / 7 / 10}{None} }{ {Bite: 1d6 + 3 / 4 / 5 (piercing)}{None} }{ {Envenom (1d4 poison damage per turn for 10 turns); ATH + FIN double in flight;}{}{100\% Cold Resistance} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Dragon}{Antipodean Opaleye}}{Perhaps the most beautiful type of dragon, it has iridescent, pearly scales and glittering, multi-coloured, pupil-less eyes, hence its name. This dragon produces a very vivid scarlet flame, though by dragon standards it is not particularly aggressive and will rarely kill unless hungry. The Antipodean opaleye is amongst the most intelligent and understanding of all the dragons.}{ {10}{3}{14/15/16}{9}{14}{10}{19}{2} }{{New Zealand}{Length}{10m}}{ {40 / 50 / 60}{Thick skin, strength 18, covers most of the body} }{ {Bite: 1d8 / 10 / 20 \\ Scratch: 1d8 + 3 / 5 / 7}{Fire Breath: 5 + 1d8 (range 10m, fire damage: moderate)} }{ {Flight (prolonged);}{}{50\% Magic Resistance (scales only)} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Dragon}{Chinese Fireball}}{The only Oriental (and also only flightless) dragon has a particularly striking appearance. Scarlet and smooth-scaled, it has a fringe of golden spikes around its snub-snouted face and extremely protuberant eyes, which distract from the atrophied wings. The Fireball gained its name for the mushroom-shaped flame that bursts from its nostrils when it is angered.  The Fireball is very aggressive, but more tolerant of its own species than most dragons, sometimes consenting to share its territory with up to two others. The fire of the Chinese Fireball burns particularly hot.}{ {14/15/16}{10}{11/12/13}{5}{9}{5}{17}{4} }{{China \& the Himalayas}{Length}{15m}}{ {35 / 40 / 45}{Thick skin, strength 15, covers most of the body} }{ {Bite: 1d6 / 8 / 10 (piercing)}{Fire Breath:  1/2/3 d10 (range 5m, fire damage: severe)} }{ {Underwater breathing + movement;}{}{50\% Fire and Cold Resistance} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Dragon}{Common Welsh Green}}{The Welsh Green blends well with the lush grass of its homeland, though it nests in the higher mountains, where a reservation has been established for its preservation. This breed is among the least troublesome of the dragons, preferring, like the Opaleye, to prey on sheep and actively avoiding humans unless provoked. Fire is issued in thin jets, and is notably colder than many other species. This species is far more at home in the sky than on the ground, unlike  most species which are cumbersome in the air.}{ {7}{8}{18}{3}{8/10/12}{10}{15}{1} }{{Snowdonia}{Length}{8m}}{ {30 / 40 / 50}{Thick skin, strength 14, covers most of the body} }{ {Bite: 1d10 + 3 / 4 / 5 (piercing)\\ Scratch: 1d 6 / 8 / 10 (slashing)}{Fire Breath: 4 + 1d8 (range 10m, fire damage: mild)} }{ {Flight (prolonged); ATH + FIN attribute are doubled in flight.}{}{50\% Fire Resistance} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Dragon}{Hebridean Black}}{Britain{\apos}s other native dragon is more aggressive than its Welsh counterpart. It requires a territory of as much as a hundred square miles per dragon. Up to thirty feet in length, the Hebridean Black is rough-scaled, with brilliant purple eyes and a line of shallow but razor-sharp ridges along its back. The Hebridean Black is noted for its brutality and cruelty, tampered only somewhat by its immense stupidity.}{ {8}{4}{15}{2}{4}{4}{19}{5} }{{Outer Hebrides}{Length}{10m}}{ {45 / 55 / 65}{Thick skin, strength 24 / 25 / 26, covers most of the body} }{ {Bite: 1d10 / 12 / 20 (piercing)}{Fire Breath: 1d12 +5/7/10 (range 10m, fire damage: moderate)} }{ {Flight (prolonged);}{}{50\% Fire Resistance} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Dragon}{Hungarian Horntail}}{Supposedly the most dangerous of all dragon breeds, the 13 Hungarian Horntail has black scales and is lizardlike in appearance. It has yellow eyes, bronze horns, and similarly coloured spikes that protrude from its long tail. The Horntail has one of the longest fire-breathing ranges (up to fifty feet).}{ {9}{3}{10}{2}{5}{3}{24}{4} }{{Hungarian Mountains}{Length}{12m}}{ {50 / 60 /70}{Thick skin, strength 20, covers most of the body} }{ {Bite: 1/2/3d8 (piercing)\\ Scratch: 1d10 + 3 / 4 / 5 (slashing)}{Fire Breath: 1d12 + 5/7/10 (range 20m, fire damage: moderate)} }{ {Flight (prolonged);}{}{50\% Fire Resistance} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Dragon}{Norwegian Ridgeback}}{The Norwegian Ridgeback resembles the Horntail in most respects, though instead of tail spikes it sports particularly prominent jet-black ridges along its back. Exceptionally aggressive to its own kind, the Ridgeback is nowadays one of the rarer dragon breeds. It has been known to attack most kinds of large land mammal and, unusually for a dragon, the Ridgeback will also feed on water-dwelling creatures.}{ {8}{4}{13}{1}{6/7/8}{6}{20/21/22}{3} }{{Scandinvia}{Length}{10m}}{ {45 / 54 / 65}{Thick skin, strength 19, covers most of the body} }{ {Bite: 1 d 8 / 10 / 20 + 5 (piercing) \\ Scratch 2d6 (slashing)}{Fire Breath: 1d10 + 4 / 8 / 12 (range 8m, fire damage: moderate)} }{ {Flight (prolonged);}{}{100\% Fire and Cold Resistance} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Dragon}{Peruvian Vipertooth}}{This is the smallest of all known dragons, and the swiftest in flight  the Peruvian Vipertooth is smooth-scaled and copper-coloured with black ridge markings. They live perpetually in flight in the turbulent airstreams above the andes, thriving in the thin air.  Delicate yet elegant, they are the strongest fliers of all the species of dragon, and rely on their manouverability over raw strength.}{ {14}{10}{8}{2}{9/10/11}{8/9/10}{14}{1} }{{Andes}{Length}{5m}}{ {30}{Thick skin, strength 10, covers most of the body} }{ {Bite 1d8 + 3 / 4 / 5 (piercing)}{Fire Breath: 1d 6 / 8/ 10 + 5 (range 2m, fire damage: mild)} }{ {Cannot move whilst on land;  ATH + FIN attribute are doubled in flight}{}{100\% Force and Concussive Resistance} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Dragon}{Romanian Longhorn}}{The Longhorn has dark-green scales and long, glittering golden horns with which it gores its prey before roasting it. When powdered, these horns are highly valued as potion ingredients, resulting in the Longhorn being hunted almost to extinction.}{ {9}{6}{10/12/14}{1}{6}{4}{17}{1} }{{Romania}{Length}{8m}}{ {30 / 40 / 50}{Thick skin, strength 20, covers most of the body} }{ {Bite 1d 6  / 8 / 10 + 4 (piercing)}{Fire Breath: 1d 12 + 3 / 4 / 5 (range 10m, fire damage: moderate)} }{ {Flight (prolonged);}{}{50\% Fire Resistance} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Dragon}{Swedish Shortsnout}}{The Swedish Short-Snout is an attractive silvery-blue dragon whose skin is sought after for the manufacture of protective gloves and shields. The flame that issues from its nostrils is a brilliant blue and can reduce timber and bone to ash in a matter of seconds.   The Short-Snout has fewer human killings to its name than most dragons, though as it prefers to live in the fjords of Scandinavia, this is unsurprising.}{ {8}{4}{9/10/11}{2}{7/9/12}{3}{18}{1} }{{Fjords of Scandinavia}{Length}{12m}}{ {45 / 50 / 55}{Thick skin, strength 16, covers most of the body} }{ {Bite: 1d 6 / 8 / 12 (piercing) \\ Scratch: 2d4/6/8 (slashing)}{Fire Breath: 3 + 2d6/8/10 (range 10m, fire damage: severe)} }{ {Flight (prolonged);}{}{50\% Fire Resistance} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Dragon}{Ukranian Ironbelly}}{The largest breed of dragon, the Ironbelly, has been known to achieve a weight of six tonnes. Rotund and slower in flight than the Vipertooth or the Longhorn, the Ironbelly is nevertheless extremely dangerous, capable of crushing dwellings on which it lands. The scales are metallic grey, the eyes deep red, and the talons particularly long and vicious.}{ {4}{1}{8/9/10}{1}{6}{3}{22}{2} }{{Ukraine and Crimea}{Length}{16m}}{ {80 / 90 / 100}{Thick skin, strength 25 / 28 / 35, covers most of the body.

It glides and slithers through marshland, feeding mainly on small mammals, and will do severe injury to the ankles of human walkers. The Dugbog{\apos}s favourite food, however, is Mandrake.}{ {8}{3}{5}{2}{3}{2}{5}{0} }{{Throughout Europe and the Americas}{Length}{30cm}}{ {10}{Driftwood protects the back, strength 6} }{ {Bite: 1d6 + 2/3/4 (piercing)}{None} }{ {Can breath underwater;}{}{100\% Fire Resistance} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Erkling}{Carniverous Elf-Demon}}{Erklings are elfish creatures, three feet tall on average (making them larger than gnomes) with pointed faces, which have a particular affinity for the taste of children. Their high pitch cackles are particularly entrancing to children, and they use this to lure them away from their guardians to eat them. These creatures also enjoy shooting darts at unsuspecting victims. Originating from the Black Forest in Germany, the difference between this creature and many others is that they can speak Human-language.}{ {7}{5}{6}{15}{10}{9}{8}{4} }{{Southern Germany}{Height}{70cm}}{ {15 / 16/ 17}{None} }{ {Scratch: 1d6 + 1 / 2 / 3 (slashing)}{Dart: 1d4 + 1 /2 / 3 (poison)} }{ {Capable of human speech;}{50\% Fire Weakness}{} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Erumpet}{Exploding-horn Rhinoceros}}{The Erumpent is a large grey African beast of great power. Weighing up to a tonne, the Erumpent may be mistaken for a rhinoceros at a distance. It has a thick hide that repels most charms and curses, a large, sharp horn upon its nose and a long, rope-like tail. Erumpents give birth to only one calf at a time. The Erumpent will not attack unless sorely provoked, but should it charge, the results are usually catastrophic. The Erumpent{\apos}s horn can pierce everything from skin to metal, and contains a deadly fluid which will cause whatever is injected with it to explode.}{ {10}{1}{9}{6}{8/10/12}{10}{14}{0} }{{African Savannahs}{Length}{3m}}{ {25 / 26 / 30}{Thick skin, strength 14, protects the entire body.} }{ {Gore: 1d8/10/12 (requires run up, piercing))}{None} }{ {Gored items explode for 1d10 concussive damage (2m radius) next turn;  Gore attack ignores all physical armour;}{}{100\% Magic Resistance (Below Expert)} }{0} \vspace{-2 cm} \\ \beast{{Fairy}{Decorative Humanoid}}{The fairy is a small and decorative beast of little intelligence. Often used or conjured by wizards for decoration, the fairy generally inhabits woodlands or glades. Ranging in height from one to five inches, the fairy has a minute humanoid body, head, and limbs but sports large insectlike wings, which may be transparent or multi-coloured, according to type. The fairy possesses a weak brand of magic that it may use to deter predators, such as the Augurey. It has a quarrelsome nature but, being excessively vain, it will become docile on any occasion when it is called to act as an ornament. Despite its humanlike appearance, the fairy cannot speak. It makes a high-pitched buzzing noise to communicate with its fellows.}{ {6}{9}{8}{10}{2}{7}{5}{0} }{{Worldwide}{Height}{5cm}}{ {5 / 6 / 7}{None} }{ {Scratch: 1d4 (slashing)}{Magical Discharge: 1d6 (range 4m, concussive)} }{ {Flight (prolonged); Can glow brightly at will;}{100\% Concussive weakness}{} }{0}\vspace{-2 cm}  & ~ & \beast{{Fire Crab}{Fire-Shooting Shelled Creature}}{Despite its name, the fire crab greatly resembles a large tortoise with a heavily jewelled shell.

Usually a favoured pet of a Dark Wizard, the runespoors in themselves are not particularly vicious. 
Each of the Runespoorï¿½s heads serves a different purpose. The left head (as seen by the wizard facing the Runespoor) is the planner.

\section{Unlife}

The unlife are those entities which were never truly alive. Often called {\it amortal}, because that which is dead may never truly be said to die, many of the most unpleasant and darkest entities in the world are considered Unlife, from the soul-sucking dementors, to the manifestations of the Elder Gods themselves. There are, however, some entities which are not inherently evil - ghosts and angels are often considered friendly and helpful, in fact.

{\it Unlife} also covers inanimate objects that have been brought to life, by magic, enchanted matter given form and thought. Golems, inferi and so on are all considered {\it unlife}.

Nothing of the original being remains beside the physical shell. The inferi feel no pain, and will keep attacking even as limbs are hacked off (and so will the limbs!), the only true way to kill an inferius is to burn it to ashes.

The only known spell that repels a lethifold is the Patronus Charm ï¿½ which brings to light a similarity with another Dark creature: the Dementor. 
Unlike a Dementor, which appears to have some physical form underneath its cloak, a lethifold is simply a cloak.

Sapients are those creatures intelligent and sociable enough to either exist within the convnetional wizarding society, or to form a society of their own. A hugely diverse group, by their very nature, sapients take different roles within their society. Therefore, the threat posed by a Sapient is not only dictated by its species, but by the role that it has within a society: a soldier is more dangerous than a librarian!

The entries in this section reflect this inherent polymorphism: species have multiple entires, one for each major societal role. 

The entries are colour coded: Blue entires are those which primarily use magic to attack, brown represents sapients which rely on physical force, and purple is non-combat entities.
