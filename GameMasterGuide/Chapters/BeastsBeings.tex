\chapter{Beasts, Beings and Other Bad Business}
\normalsize
There are 3 classes of entity in this game: Beasts, Un\minus{}life and Sapients. 

Beasts are living beings without intelligence or self awareness, or with such a staggering level of violence and hatred that they cannot interact with other Sapients without imminent danger. Most beasts cannot use magic consciously, but may have innate magical abilities. 

Sapients are those creatures with intelligence, language and society. Mostly humanoids (though with a few exceptions), sapients can often wield magic with intent, unlike the mindless usage of the beasts. All player characters must be sapients. For political reasons, the word {\it Beings} is often used, though Sapients such as Centaurs and the Merpeople object to sharing this category with, for example, the hags, and hence are often classified as {\it beasts}, despite their evidently sapient nature. 

The Un\minus{}Life are those beings which cannot truly be called alive, and are often either inert matter brought to some mimicry of life by a spellcaster, or raw manifestations of pure magic. Often thought of as abominations due to creatures such as Dementors and Inferi, the Un\minus{}Life are often incredibly alien and hard to understand.
