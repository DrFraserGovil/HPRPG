\chapter{Beasts, Beings and Other Bad Business}
\normalsize
% There are 3 classes of entity in this game: Beasts, Un\minus{}life and Sapients. 

% Beasts are living beings without intelligence or self awareness, or with such a staggering level of violence and hatred that they cannot interact with other Sapients without imminent danger. Most beasts cannot use magic consciously, but may have innate magical abilities. 

% Sapients are those creatures with intelligence, language and society. Mostly humanoids (though with a few exceptions), sapients can often wield magic with intent, unlike the mindless usage of the beasts. All player characters must be sapients. For political reasons, the word {\it Beings} is often used, though Sapients such as Centaurs and the Merpeople object to sharing this category with, for example, the hags, and hence are often classified as {\it beasts}, despite their evidently sapient nature. 

% The Un\minus{}Life are those beings which cannot truly be called alive, and are often either inert matter brought to some mimicry of life by a spellcaster, or raw manifestations of pure magic. Often thought of as abominations due to creatures such as Dementors and Inferi, the Un\minus{}Life are often incredibly alien and hard to understand. 

Throughout the centuries that wizardkind has studied the magical and mundane creatures of the world, there have been many different attempts to classify them into some kind of coherent taxonomy. Of these, two different systems have become considered the conventional mehtod of classifying beings of all kinds - though of course the exact boundaries remains a matter of intense debate. 

Beings of all kinds are classified based on two different properties: their {\it  mind}, and their {\it type}. 

\section{Minds}

The mind possessed by a being determines how they think, behave and perceive the world.

\subsection{Sapient}

Sapients are those creatures with consciousness, and intrinsic awareness of the self. Alongside this (usually) comes intelligence, language and society. All humanoids are considered Sapients, though not all Sapients are humanoids.  

For political reasons, the word {\it Beings} is often used to describe Sapient creatures, with {\it Beasts} used for Non-sapient creatures. However this is considered a very politically charged terms, and Sapients such as Centaurs and the Merpeople object to sharing this category with, for example, the hags, and hence are often classified as {\it beasts}, despite their evidently sapient nature. 

Sapient creatures are often able to use magic, and are capable of adapting and formulating complex tactics and plans. 

\subsection{Non-sapient}

Non-sapient creatures are those which, whilst they have a (mostly) recognisable brain, containing recognisable thoughts, they do not possess a true consciousness. 

This should not be confused with a lack of intelligence: some non-sapient creatures have analytical and problem-solving skills which far outsrip a human. However, their lack of consciousness generally means that they lack the ability to reason and make conscious decisions - they instead rely purely on their more animalistic instincts. 

Whilst generally considered to lie outside the axis of `good' and `evil', due to their intrinic lack of morality and ethics, some non-sapient creatures can be incredibly caring, whilst others are vicious. When a non-sapient being is described as `good' or `evil', it should therefore be understood in these more primal terms.  

\subsection{Ineffable}

A creature which possesses an {\it Ineffable} mind has a consciousness that is beyond the realm of the humanoid mind to conceive. The very classification of sapience or not is entirely irrelevant to their being. Spirits, and abominations are generally considered `ineffable', as are the most powerful celestials.  

The term `unliving' is also used to apply to beings which have an ineffable mind, due to the popular image that such creatures are not truly `alive' in the sense that we would consider them. 

Ineffable creatures often originate from extraplanar dimensions, or were created by ancient and primal magics. They are therefore often susceptible to {\it Celestial} attacks, which uses alien energy to strip away at whatever constitutes a soul for these creatures. 


\section{Types}

The {\it type} of a creature denotes how creatures are related to each other, and gives a hint at their intrinsic nature. Creatures which share a `type' often have many characteristics in common - though this is not always guaranteed. 

Though often closely linked (most creatures of a humanoid {\it type} have a sapient {\it mind}), many creatures of the same type have a different kind of mind. 

\newcommand\type[2]
{
	\textbf{\textit{#1:}} #2
}
\type{Abomination}{An abomination is an incomprehensibly alien creature from the depths of the Eldritch Domains\comma{} or even the Void Beyond. Primal\comma{} extraplanar beings\comma{} even attempting to comprehend the existence of such creatures is enough to break the minds of weaker individuals.}

\type{Beast}{A beast is a non\minus{}humanoid and (generally) non\minus{}sapient creature of magical or mundane nature\comma{} which forms a natural part of the life cycle in their environment. Almost all non\minus{}magical creatures are classified as beasts\comma{} as are many of the most common magical creatures.}

\type{Celestial}{Celestials are natives of some of the more distant higher planes\comma{} such as the heavenly Elysium\comma{} or the awful Tartarus. Angels\comma{} Devils and other beings form the bulk of the Celestials\comma{} normally possessing incredible power they have\comma{} throughout history\comma{} been mistaken for servants of the Gods and sometimes even for gods in their own right.}

\type{Construct}{A construct is an artificially created being. Usually constructed from inorganic materials such as metal\comma{} stone or clay and animated using powerful magic or technological means. Though not considered {\it alive}\comma{} some constructs contain a Sapient mind\comma{} though most are mindless automatons.}

\type{Demon}{Demons are malevolent magical creatures\comma{} often posessing an intrinsic affinity with the Dark Arts\comma{} and a thirst for human flesh. Demons can take many forms\comma{} and can be found across the multiverse. Some demons\comma{} like elementals\comma{} harbour an affinity for a certain aspect of the universe\comma{} others serve powerful beings\comma{} and some demons rise to power in their own right and crown themselves {\it Demon Princes}. Most of the truly horrifying demons have been banished from the mortal realm\comma{} leaving behind only minor evils such as the Grindylow or the Kappa. Sometimes\comma{} however\comma{} a Dark Witch or Wizard reaches through the barriers between worlds and pulls one of the more abhorrent powers into this world.}

\type{Draconid}{A dragon or dragon\minus{}like creature\comma{} usually characterised by an enormous reptilian form and affinity for elemental flame. Often possessing both incredible physical and magical power\comma{} any member of the Draconid family should be treated with fear and respect\comma{} the True Dragons most of all.}

\type{Elemental}{Elementals are creatures which embody one of the classical elements: fire\comma{} air\comma{} water\comma{} or earth (as well as many others). Most hail from one of the Elemental Planes\comma{} though many magical creatures native to the Mortal Plane are considered Elementals\comma{} such as the Ashwinder Snake\comma{} or the Frost Salamander.}

\type{Flora}{Strictly speaking\comma{} flora is a catchall term for all plant life. In this context\comma{} however\comma{} it includes a range of magical plants\comma{} imbued with a degree of ambulation\comma{} movement or other means of interacting with the outside world.}

\type{Gigantoid}{The gigantoids are a family of oversized human\minus{}esque creatures. Though large in frame\comma{} they are often incredibly dim\minus{}witted and slow. Trolls\comma{} ogres and giants form the core of the gigantoid family.}

\type{Humanoid}{The group of beings generally referred to as {\it people}\comma{} the humanoid groups comprises of all the human subspecies \minus{} both wizarding and muggle \minus{} as well as the semi\minus{}human creatures such as Centaurs\comma{} Merpeople\comma{} Goblins and Veela. Half\minus{}giants often find themselves in the humanoid category\comma{} whilst their full\minus{}giant kin are considered Gigantoids.}

\type{Imp}{The imps are vaguely humanoid creatures\comma{} though besides the Elves\comma{} they mostly possess only limited intellect. An imp is immediately distinguised from even the shortest dwarf by their diminutive stature (rarely reaching more than 2 feet in height)\comma{} and their innate magic which seems to operate on entirely different rules to that used by most humanoids. Elves\comma{} hobgoblins and fairies are the most prominent member of the imp family.}

\type{Monster}{Many beings classified as {\it monsters} could feasibly be considered {\it beasts}\comma{} in the strictest sense of the word. However\comma{} whilst a beast can live in harmony inside its ecological niche (even if that necessitates aggression and special abilities)\comma{} a monster is nothing but a disruptive and lethal influence\comma{} and often form the centre of dangerous myths and legends. Monsters are almost universally destructive\comma{} vicious and incredibly dangerous to face.}

\type{Phantasm}{A phantasm is a non\minus{}corporeal or ghostly being\comma{} often associated with the souls of departed individuals\comma{} and manifestations of primal forces in the mortal plane.}

\type{Sprite}{Sprites are creatures which straddle worlds\comma{} often existing as much in the Astral Realm as they do in the mortal realm. Sometimes corporeal\comma{} and sometimes ghostly\comma{} the sprites are united in their overarching goodness and fondness for living beings. Often considered by muggles to be guardian spirits\comma{} the Sprites often choose an area or a domain to protect\comma{} and their rage when their protection is violated can be potent.}

\type{Undead}{The undead are profane creations\comma{} the mortal remains of a once\minus{}living creature reanimated by powerful necromantic magic\comma{} or posessed by an evil spirit. The Walking Corpses\comma{} as well as Vampires\comma{} fall into this category.}

\section{Rating}

The Department of Magical Beasts, an important part of the Ministry of Magic, maintains a classification scheme to determine the threat posed by individual magical creatures. This classification system breaks beings down into 8 categories. 



\newcommand\vRow[3]{
#1	&	#2	&	#3	\\
}
\begin{center}
\begin{rndtable}{c c p{10 cm}}
\bf Category	&	\bf Encounter Value & \bf Description
\\
	\vRow{0}{0}{Utterly harmless, incapable of inflicting harm}
	\vRow{I}{2}{\squote{Boring}, capable of inflicting only tiny injuries}
	\vRow{II}{10}{Mostly harmless, commonly domesticated}
	\vRow{III}{25}{Poses only minimal danger to a capable individual}
	\vRow{IV}{50}{A group of competent individuals can handle, though an individual would face serious harm.}
	\vRow{V}{75}{Requires specialist knowledge, or a group of highly trained individuals to defeat}
	\vRow{VI}{100}{Known Wizard-Killer, impossible to control or train. Requires a large group of exceptionally trained warriors to defeat}
	\vRow{VII}{150}{Lethal, poses a viable extinction-level threat to population centres if left unchecked. Few-to-no examples in recorded history of wizards successfully defeating them.}

\section{Constructing Encounters}

The `encounter value' is provided to help GMs construct viable, yet challenging scenarios for players. 

For each character in the party, add together twice their total character level, to calculate an `encounter budget'. For an easy encounter you may half this value, whilst for a particularly challenging one, you may double it. 

For each beast or being in the encounter, add together the encounter value associated with them, and then multiply the result by the modifier found in the `group attack' table below. 

\newcommand\EV[2]{ #1 &	$\times$ #2 \\}
\begin{rndtable}{c c}
\bf Beasts in Encounter	&	\bf Encounter Value Multiplier
\\
\EV{1}{1}
\EV{2-3}{1.5}
\EV{4-5}{2}
\EV{6-8}{3}
\EV{9-10}{4}
\EV{10+}{5}
\end{rndtable}

If the values are comparable, then the encounter is probably suited for the group.
