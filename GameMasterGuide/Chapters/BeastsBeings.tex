% There are 3 classes of entity in this game: Beasts, Un\minus{}life and Sapients. 

% Beasts are living beings without intelligence or self awareness, or with such a staggering level of violence and hatred that they cannot interact with other Sapients without imminent danger. Most beasts cannot use magic consciously, but may have innate magical abilities. 

% Sapients are those creatures with intelligence, language and society. Mostly humanoids (though with a few exceptions), sapients can often wield magic with intent, unlike the mindless usage of the beasts. All player characters must be sapients. For political reasons, the word {\it Beings} is often used, though Sapients such as Centaurs and the Merpeople object to sharing this category with, for example, the hags, and hence are often classified as {\it beasts}, despite their evidently sapient nature. 

% The Un\minus{}Life are those beings which cannot truly be called alive, and are often either inert matter brought to some mimicry of life by a spellcaster, or raw manifestations of pure magic. Often thought of as abominations due to creatures such as Dementors and Inferi, the Un\minus{}Life are often incredibly alien and hard to understand.

\section{Constructing Encounters}

The `encounter value' is provided to help GMs construct viable, yet challenging scenarios for players. 

For each character in the party, add together twice their total character level, to calculate an `encounter budget'. For an easy encounter you may half this value, whilst for a particularly challenging one, you may double it. 

For each beast or being in the encounter, add together the encounter value associated with them, and then multiply the result by the modifier found in the `group attack' table below. 

\newcommand\EV[2]{ #1 &	$\times$ #2 \\}
\begin{rndtable}{c c}
\bf Beasts in Encounter	&	\bf Encounter Value Multiplier
\\
\EV{1}{1}
\EV{2-3}{1.5}
\EV{4-5}{2}
\EV{6-8}{3}
\EV{9-10}{4}
\EV{10+}{5}
\end{rndtable}

If the values are comparable, then the encounter is probably suited for the group.

\species{Abyssal Spawn}{In the most alien and horrifying corners of the multiverse\comma{} deep within the Eldritch Domains dwell creatures beyond mortal comprehension. Mounds of twisting\comma{} writhing tentacles and unblinking eyes which never see light\comma{} their minds ancient and alien\comma{} with desires and motivations which would cause a human to wretch. 

On the rare occasions that these abyssal\comma{} eldritch horrors require something in one of the lower planes\comma{} they send a posse of their enumerable children to execute their will: the {\it Abyssal Spawn}.

\species{Elf}{Modern muggle culture frequently imagines Elves to be superhuman\comma{} immortal and otherworldly creatures – outwardly appearing as impossibly beautiful humans and wielding immense\comma{} primal magic. This is primarly due to the influence of the muggle writer Tolkein (who was himself a squib). In reality\comma{} elves are much closer to those envisaged in medieval Germanic mythology – small\comma{} impish tricksters. 

Though they have a love for tricks and fun\comma{} the most common form of elf throughout history\comma{} the {\it Br{\'u}nb{\'a}su}\comma{} or {\it Common Brownie} often helped humans by performing small chores for them. In one of the more shameful acts of wizarding history\comma{} the Br{\'u}nb{\'a}su were then systematically enslaved and brainwashed into eternal servitude\comma{} leading to the creation of the race of House\minus{}Elves. Witnessing this horrific act of human cruelty\comma{} many of the other elf species retreated into relative obscurity.

\ability{Diminutive Frame}{Almost all species of Elf are tiny in stature – rarely reaching more than 3ft in height – with skinny and spindly arms and legs. They rely on magic for physical acts that their size denies them. }

\ability{Elfin Magics}{Elf magic is unlike any that is understood by humans\comma{} who often look down on it as inferior. Some scholars\comma{} however\comma{} have hypothesised that elfin magic is in fact far superior to wizard magic. It is only due to the elfin spirit and its dislike of organisation and study (and probably helped by wizard oppression) that they have not learned to harness it to its full potential. The most prominent quirk of elfin magic is their ability to ignore even the strongest magical wards and boundaries.}  

\ability{Fond of Trickery}{All elves (except perhaps the brainwashed House Elves) are fond of trickery and fun. They play endless pranks on one another\comma{} delighting in causing small amounts of chaos. Even those who are dedicated to cleaning and tidying play the occassional trick: muggles notice this in the form of missing socks\comma{} or keys never quite being where they were left.}

\ability{Holding Court}{Elven society is chaotic and unorganised. They rarely recognise a leader\comma{} though they sometimes assemble themselves into bands and groups for the purpose of safety. This all changes when one of the Elven Princes summons them to their Seelie Court. Every free\minus{}elf belongs to one of these courts\comma{} which is presided over by one of the more powerful Hulduf{\'o}lk. Court is only summoned in times of great emergency\comma{} such as conflict with another court\comma{} or when a great external threat is detected.}}{

The \name{} reside within a group of dimensions known as the {\it Seelie Courts}\comma{} which lie close to the Astral realm. Each Seelie Court is a verdant paradise\comma{} populated entirely by elves\comma{} both those species which are found on Earth\comma{} and myriad others.

Each Court is ruled over by an Elf\minus{}Prince\comma{} the most powerful \name{} in the Court\comma{} as well as their advisors and attendants. Typically these offices are all held by other \name{}s\comma{} though rarely you may find a Dun\ae{}lf or V\ae{}ttir who has risen through the ranks of the Court to serve in these lofty positions. 

Even those elves which reside on Earth are (technically) members of a Court\comma{} and must obey the summons from their Prince when it is time for them to attend their Seelie Court\comma{} failure to do so leads to expulsion (or worse). In reality\comma{} however\comma{} the Seelie Courts are rarely called in such a manner and Earthbound elves may not even know that they belong to a Court until the summons arrives. 

The \name{} wield immense and powerful magic\comma{} which they primarily use to cause mischief\comma{} mayhem and to disrupt the plans of the other members of the courts. The most famous conflict between various courts is that between Oberon and Titania\comma{} with the conflict spilling over into the Mortal Plane on more than one occasion\comma{} even making its way into the muggle subconscious. 

On rare occasions a Court can become corrupted by evil – either due to the profane actions of the Prince themselves\comma{} or because of some external corrupting influence such as a Voidic Incursion. A corrupted court is known as an {\it Unseelie Court}\comma{} and is often a source of violence\comma{} conflict and further corruption.

\species{Giants}{Giants are very large bipdal beings\comma{} growing up to 8m ($\sim$25ft) in height. Many giants appear to be simply humongous humans\comma{} whilst others have disproportionate features\comma{} such as long arms which drag along the floor\comma{} or oversized heads. Rarer still are those which possess more bestial features\comma{} such as elongated fangs\comma{} thick green hide or snouted noses. There is no known rhyme or reason for how such features arise in the giant genetics\comma{} as members of even close family can vary wildly in their outward appearance. 

What is a constant amongst all giants is their phenomenal strength and their willingness to use it. Wizarding history has recorded bloody inter\minus{}giant wars going back millenia\comma{} and there have been more than several occasions of giants turning their ferocity onto wizardkind\comma{} which has led to a general distrust\comma{} fear and even hatred of the giant clans\comma{} which was only exacerbated when the Northern Clans joined forces with Voldemort during the Wizarding Wars. 

\ability{Organised Society}{Though to wizards the giants appear chaotic\comma{} violent and disorganised\comma{} they possess a highly rigid society within and between clans. The {\bf Gurg} is the warleader\comma{} who rules the clan in all matters related to combat: they decide when to send out raiding and hunting parties and when war is declared. The Gurg is the mightiest warrior in the clan – a new Gurg is chosen by another warrior defeating them in single combat\comma{} often to the death. The {\bf Council of Elders} rules the clan in all other matters\comma{} and resolves internal disputes. Membership of the council is determined by a rudimentary form of democracy in a ritual which predates even Athenian democracy. }

\ability{Intelligent Beings}{Though generally not as intelligent as humans\comma{} giants are significantly more intelligent than mere beasts\comma{} as well as other gigantoid bretheren such as Trolls. They are capable of manufacturing and using armour\comma{} weapons and tools both in battle\comma{} and in every day life. In many ways\comma{} giant technology is similar to human society $\sim$2000 years ago. }

\ability{Prideful}{Though their relative lack of intelligence is well known in the wizarding community\comma{} it is a point of some contention amongst the giants\comma{} who wish to be seen as just as intelligent as the other sapient races. Virtually all negative interactions between giants and humans has arisen because the humans condescended giants\comma{} or otherwise lorded their intelligence over the giants. When dealing with giants\comma{} it is almost always best to restrain the urge to show off – use simple sentences and ideas\comma{} give the giants time and space to think things through and\comma{} most importantly\comma{} not make a big deal out of behaving in this fashion. }

\ability{Resilience}{Full\minus{}blooded Giants are potentially even more resistant to magic than dragons\comma{} requiring exceptionally powerful magic to subdue them. Though their skin appears no more protective than normal humans\comma{} their large size means standard weaponry does not pose much of a threat to them\comma{} though it does irritate them. }

\ability{Magic Appreciation}{Though they cannot wield magic themselves\comma{} giants are aware of magic and find the idea of it fascinating (as long as it is not being used agains them that is). The best way to integrate yourself with a giant is to provide them with a spectactular show of magic\comma{} and gift them a magical device or trinket.}}{

The process of creating a Horcrux requires the subject to shatter their soul\comma{} which leaves their essence unstable\comma{} pushing them closer to insanity and abject evil.

This destruction of the soul is the spiritual equivalent of splitting the atom\comma{} releasing a tremendous amount of energy into the higher planes\comma{} even to the point of weakening the barriers between worlds. 

Such a release of energy rarely goes unnoticed by the creeping\comma{} crawling horrors lying in the void – driven insane by their time spent in abject nothingness.
