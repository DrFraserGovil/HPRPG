\subsection{Archetype Features}

\feat{Investigator's Insight}

From 1st level, you gain a +2 bonus to Perception 

\jump
\feat{Always Alert}

At 2nd level you gain a +1 bonus to your passive perception value, and an additional +1 for every 3 Investigator levels above 2nd.

\jump
\feat{Interrogator\apos{}s Demeanour}

At 3rd level, and then again at 6th, 11th and 14th, you gain a +1 bonus to either Persuasion or Intimidation proficiencies (you may choose a different proficiency at every increase).

\jump\feat{Interview}

From 4th level, if you are able to isolate a captured (or willing) target, you may initiate an interview. Target performs a SPR (Willpower) Resist check against either a d10 CHR (Persuasion) check or d10 POW (Intimidation) check. If target fails to get the greater value, they must tell you at least one piece of true information. The investigator, however, does not get to know if the check succeeded. 

\jump\feat{Good-cop/Bad-cop}

From 8th level, when performing an Interview, you may perform both Persuasion and Intimidation checks and sum the result for the check. 

\jump\feat{Research Team}

At 10th level, you have gathered the resources to form an in-house research team. If you are able to contact your team to ask them a question, after 1 day of research, they provide you with a +5 bonus to all research checks on an individual subject (i.e. a person, event, or location) for the next 1 hour. This ability may only be used once per week. 

\jump\feat{Undercover}

From 12th level, gain a bonus to your Stealth proficiency equal to one-third your Investigator level. 

You may also take 1 hour to completely alter your appearance and create a false identity. Whilst inhabiting this new identity, you gain an additional +2 bonus to Persuasion and Stealth proficiencies when on `undercover missions'. 


\jump\feat{Illusive Deduction}

At 16th level, your deductive skills are honed such that you can spot inconsistencies when someone attempts to alter your perception of reality. When an illusion spell is cast on you, in addition to the usual Perception checks, the GM rolls a d4. If it comes up as a 1, they must inform you that an illusion spell has been cast on you. 


\subsection{Detective}

\feat{Arrest}

From 3rd level, you may place handcuffs/manacles on an incapacitated humanoid as a major action. This creature must succeed on a DV 15 ATH (Strength) check to escape. When all antagonists have been likewise incapacited, you may take 1 minute to perform a ritual spell to send them to a holding cell in Azkaban, where escape is near-impossible. 

\jump
\feat{Combat De-Escalation}

From 5th level, you may use one of the following tactics 

\jump
\feat{Gut Instinct}

From 7th level if, during an {\it Interview}, you perform a check that is at least 2 below the Resist check, your gut instinct allows you to infer that the target is lying to you. 

\subsection{Journalist}

\feat{Eavesdrop}

At 3rd level, you may hear all verbal communication in a 5m radius, even if whispered or behind a door, as if you had the {\it Eavesdrop} charm permanently active. 

At 8th and 15th level, this increases to 10 and 20m radius respectively.
