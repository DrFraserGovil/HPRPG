\section{Empath}

You feel their eyes burrowing into you. They're seeing not just the physical form, but are seeing straight into your soul. An empath knows you better than you know yourself -- inside and out. They achieve this, not through magical spells, but through their deep and abiding compassion -- coupled to a heightened perceptive sense. Often nomadic in nature, Empaths travel not to see the world or experience adventures -- but to help as many people as possible. 

Some Empaths dedicate their lives to using this increased perception to peer beyond the mystic veil, and learn the true secrets of the cosmos; the {\bf Seers}. Some dedicate their lives to helping others, and use their ability to heal the sick and wounded; {\bf Healers}. The root of their power, is their empathy and compassion for all living beings.
