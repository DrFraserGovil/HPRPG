\section{Gryffindor Student}
The Sorting Hat tells us that:
\begin{displayquote}
\it You might belong in Gryffindor,
\\
Where dwell the brave at heart,
\\
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
\\
Set Gryffindors apart
\end{displayquote}
Gryffindor is the House that prizes bravery above all other attributes. The ability to stare terror and adversity in the face without blinking or shirking your responsibilities is a must-have if you are to belong to this House. A Gryffindor student is strong and chivalrous, but they can also be headstrong and arrogant. Never afraid to make a joke, or question authority, Gryffindor students are often difficult to control in the classroom.

Gryffindor students typically settle into one of two routes: the Sportsman and the Rebel. The sporty students are physically very capable, and get increased attributes associated with their chosen sport, as well as general improvements to their health. The more rebellious students, on the other hand, have a knack for causing trouble -- and more importantly, getting away with it.
