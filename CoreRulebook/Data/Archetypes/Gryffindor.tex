\section{Gryffindor Student}
The Sorting Hat tells us that:
\begin{displayquote}
\it You might belong in Gryffindor,
\\
Where dwell the brave at heart,
\\
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
\\
Set Gryffindors apart
\end{displayquote}
Gryffindor is the House that prizes bravery above all other attributes. The ability to stare terror and adversity in the face without blinking or shirking your responsibilities is a must-have if you are to belong to this House. A Gryffindor student is strong and chivalrous
