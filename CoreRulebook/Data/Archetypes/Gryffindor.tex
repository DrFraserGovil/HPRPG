The Sorting Hat tells us that:
\begin{displayquote}
\it You might belong in Gryffindor,
\\
Where dwell the brave at heart,
\\
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
\\
Set Gryffindors apart
\end{displayquote}
Gryffindor is the House that prizes bravery above all other attributes. The ability to stare terror and adversity in the face without blinking or shirking your responsibilities is a must\minus{}have if you are to belong to this House. A Gryffindor student is strong and chivalrous, but they can also be headstrong and arrogant. Never afraid to make a joke, or question authority, Gryffindor students are often difficult to control in the classroom.

\section*{Acquired Feats}


\feat{Token of Courage}{The Token of Courage symbolises everything that Gryffindor House stands for: bravery, honour and conviction in yourself and your fundamental beliefs. \\~\\
You may use this Token once per day to give yourself check\minus{}advantage on all Spirit checks for the next hour.}

\feat{Unbreakable Spirit}{At second level, your will becomes iron. Whenever you take a strike which would normally leave you bleeding out, you may perform a DV 10 Willpower Resist check. \\~\\ If this check succeeds succeeds, you power through the pain and rise up with a burst of renewed strength, restoring 2d4 + character level Health Points. This ability can be used only once per long rest.}

\feat{Provocative Words}{At 2nd level, you gain the ability to provoke sapient beings into attacking you. \\~\\Select a target living being within hearing range, and force them to perform a Willpower Resist check, using your normal subjugation value. If it fails, the target must enter into combat as the aggressor. If you are already in combat with the target, they must focus exclusively on you for 1d4 turn cycles.}

\feat{Unnerving Bravery}{Your ability to stare down evil and terror is, in itself, worrying to those who are trying to bring terror into your heart. \\~\\ From 3rd level, whenever a being fails an intimidation check on you, your reaction is intimidating enough to trigger an automatic Intimidation check back on the initiating party. This effect is nullified if both parties have {\it Unnerving Bravery} or an equivalent ability. }
