\section{Gryffindor Student}
The Sorting Hat tells us that:
\begin{displayquote}
\it You might belong in Gryffindor,
\\
Where dwell the brave at heart,
\\
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
\\
Set Gryffindors apart
\end{displayquote}
Gryffindor is the House that prizes bravery above all other attributes. The ability to stare terror and adversity in the face without blinking or shirking your responsibilities is a must-have if you are to belong to this House. A Gryffindor student is strong and chivalrous, but they can also be headstrong and arrogant. Never afraid to make a joke, or question authority, Gryffindor students are often difficult to control in the classroom.

Gryffindor students typically settle into one of two routes: the Sportsman and the Jester. The sporty students are physically very capable
