\feat{Druidic Aspect}
{
	When a Druid first feels the call of the wild, the urge to protect and guide nature, they embark on a profound spiritual journey, during which they bind their soul to one of three ephemeral aspects of nature. 
	
	You may choose to follow the Tree\minus{}Loving Dryads, the Elemental Nymphs, or the Beastial Satyrs. 
	
	Your choice of Druidic Aspect grants you additional abilities at 1st, 4th, 7th, 11th, 15th, 18th and 20th level. These, along with more details about the Aspects, can be found at the end of the Archetype. 
}


\feat{Nature Affinity}
{
	From 1st level, a Druid learns a deep respect for all things natural \minus{} and where possible, attempts to eschew artificial products. 
	
	Druids may only use their proficiency bonus on weapons or armour made from natural products \minus{} wood, leather and so on, but not smelted iron or synthetic fibres. In return, they are automatically proficient in all such items. 
	
	In addition, at 9th level, and again at 17th level, your affinity towards such weapons increases, allowing you to make an additional strike whenever you perform a full turn attack. 
}




\feat{Nature Senses}
{
From 2nd level, a Druid's senses are deeply intertwined with their fundamental connection to nature. 

Whilst in contact with some significant aspect of the natural world \minus{} feet on untouched earth, or placing a hand on a mighty oak \minus{} a Druid gains advantage on all Perception checks. 
}

\feat{Reclaim Nature}
{
	At 4th level, you gain the ability to imbue artificial objects with a semblance of the organic, natural energy they once possessed. 
	
	Upon touching an object manufactured from some visible natural substance, such as a wooden table, or a stone statue, you may imbue it with magical energy, and encourage it to retake its natural form in some way. The table might put down roots and begin to grow, whilst the statue might accumulate dust until it resembles a boulder. 

	This ability cannot bring about instantaneous, drastic change, but merely allows you to guide objects back into the natural cycle of being. 
}

\feat{Organic Repose}
{
	At 6th level, when you take a short rest in a natural area, gain additional Recovery Dice equal to one-third your Druid level. 
}

\feat{Nature\apos{}s Shrine}
{
	At 10th level, your connection to nature becomes powerful enough to imbue an entire area with natural, organic energues.
	
	By expending 3 hours work, you can create a small shrine in a natural place â€“ maybe a stone circle, or a clearing in a wood, decorated with feathers and other such totems of nature. This shrine covers an area up to 3 metres in radius. 

	Beings which take a Long Rest inside the Shrine find that they lose an additional level of exhaustion to normal, and if they had no exhaustion to begin with, they wake with the {\it Calm Mind} status effect. 
	
	You remain aware of any being entering any Shrine you have created, as if they had a {\it Caterwauling Ward} placed upon them.
