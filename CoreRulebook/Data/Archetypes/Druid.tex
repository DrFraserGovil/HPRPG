\section*{Acquired Feats}

\feat{Nature Affinity}
{
	From 1st level, a Druid learns a deep respect for all things natural \minus{} and where possible, attempts to eschew artificial products. 
	
	Druids may only use their proficiency bonus on weapons or armour made from natural products \minus{} wood, leather and so on, but not smelted iron or synthetic fibres. In return, they are automatically proficient in all such items. 
}

\feat{Aspect of Nature}
{
From 1st level, a Druid gains the ability to summon {\it Aspects}, powerful spirits and forces of nature which imbue them with special abilities. Unless otherwise stated, Summoning an Aspect takes a minor action, and can be done once per long rest. The number of aspects that can be summoned increases with your Druid level, as shown in the Archetype table. 

At first level, you have access to all the {\it Druidic} aspects. You gain access to more aspects when you form your soul bond at 3rd level. Aspects, and their descriptions, are given at the end of the class description. 

To use an aspect, you must first have it {\it prepared}. You prepare an aspect by spending at least one night sleeping in the wild, or otherwise near a source of great natural power, at which point you may select a number of aspects equal to twice your Power modifier (minimum 1) to become ``prepared". You may use any of these prepared aspects until you perform another preparation action, at which you replace them with a new choice.
}
\feat{Nature Senses}
{
From 2nd level, a Druid's senses are deeply intertwined with their fundamental connection to nature. 

Whilst in contact with some significant aspect of the natural world \minus{} feet on untouched earth, or placing a hand on a mighty oak \minus{} a Druid gains advantage on all Perception checks.
