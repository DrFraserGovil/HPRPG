\section{Auror}

Her wand at the ready, poised for action, the Auror peers around the corner, looking for her targets. She has tracked these dangerous criminals halfway across the country, trying to protect the innocent from their evil goals. With a leap, she emerges from cover and with a series of casts quicker than the eye can see, manages to incapacitate her foes. The world is just a little bit safer thaks to her hard work. 

Aurors are the highly trained combat operations arm of the Office for Magical Law Enforcement. Their job is to track down and eliminate the threat posed by dark wizards and wizards, and to protect those who would otherwise come to harm. Experts in combat magic, Aurors are not to be trifled with. 

The Auror office recognises two streams of officers, the {\bf Enforcers} and the {\bf Warders}. The Enforcers form the strike capabalities of the office, specialising in infiltration, target acquisition and shock tactics, whilst the Warders specialise in area denial, and collateral limitations.
