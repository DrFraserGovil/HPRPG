\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Ravenclaw Student}

Their hearts full of a desire for learning, but their eyes blinking against the harsh light of day, Ravenclaw students often make unwilling adventurers \minus{}\minus{} preferring instead the comfort of a cosy library. 
\begin{displayquote}
\it Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
\\
If you've a ready mind,
\\
Where those of wit and learning,
\\
Will always find their kind.
\end{displayquote}
Ravenclaw is the house that prizes knowledge and an inquisitive mind above all other traits. Often members of this house are the most advanced spellcasters in their year, but their lack of practical experience and physical ineptitude means they're not always the best in every situation.

\section{Acquired Feats}



\feat{Token of Knowledge}{Acquired at 1st level, the Token of Knowledge symbolises everything that Ravenclaw House stands for: knowledge, wisdom, learning and a razor sharp mind. \\~\\
You may use this Token once per day to give yourself check\minus{}advantage on all Intelligence checks for the next hour.}

\feat{Passion Project}{From 2nd level, you may choose a passion project to focus on. \\~\\ A passion project is a specific area in which a witch or wizard has devoted their time and energy, becoming far better at it than would otherwise be expected. Choose an individual spell or tool to obsess over. Any time you are asked to make a check associated with your obsession, you may take check\minus{}advantage. \\~\\ You can change your passion project, but doing so requires an upheaval of your psyche:  one of dedicated work in which you do not use the old passion project, before the change holds. }

\feat{True Expertise}{There are varying levels of brilliance. Some people are very good at a lot of things, whilst others are truly outstanding at a small number of things.  \\~\\When you reach level 3, you find out which of those people you are. Choose from the following list:

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Deep and Narrow}: Choose 2 spell, tool or skill proficiencies. You double your expertise bonus on any checks relating to these topics. 
	\item {\bf Shallow but Broad}: Choose 3 new spell disciplines, tools or skills to become proficient in.  
\end{itemize}
}

\feat{Advanced Spellcasting}{By level 3, you discover that your knowledge of spellwork has advanced faster than is normally expected of a student. 
\\~\\
 You gain access to Novice level spells one level early, to reflect your rapid progress.
