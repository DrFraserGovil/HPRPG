\section{Artificer}

Their artful hands always busy, their focus on the emerging magical item in front of them, and their magics being channeled in incomprehensibly complex ways, the Artificer is the master of item creation. They are experts at using their hand to mold both material, and magic -- often mixing the two in ways that have never been done before. Some Artificers produce their items for sale, whilst some hoard their creations for their own personal use.

Artificers may choose to focus their craft into two divergent fields: the {\bf Spellbinders} focus their might into imbuing physical items with magical effects, whilst the {\bf Alchemists} use their craftsmanship to produce magnificent potions and deadly poisons.
