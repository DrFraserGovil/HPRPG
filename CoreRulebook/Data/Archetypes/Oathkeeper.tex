\section{Oathkeeper}

An oathkeeper is an individual who has dedicated their life to a cause, putting it before everything else. Their every action is geared towards fufilling the promise that they have made. Oathkeepers come in two varieties, the {\bf advocate}, who has sworn to uphold a right, or a principle, with their power coming from within. The {\bf disciple} on the other hand has sworn fealty to a powerful being, which gants them immense powers.
