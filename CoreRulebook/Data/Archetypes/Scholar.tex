\section*{Acquired Feats}

\feat{Higher Education}
{
From first level, a scholar starts with a very high level of education \minus{} they have proficiency in all areas associated with `Intelligence', and possess an affinity for Temporal magic. 
}

\feat{Intellectual Analysis}
{
At 1st level, your years of education allow you to cast a critical eye over an opponent, and learn what to expect from them. 

As a major action, you may {\it Survey} a being within 10m of you which you can see. By observing it over a number of seconds, you can deduce its behaviour, and anticipate where it will be and what it will do. This effect fails if the creature has an intelligence greater than you. 

For the next minute (or until you survey another being), this being takes a penalty to its accuracy rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier, and you may perform any Resist checks imposed on you by this being using a Logic check, rather than the indicated one. 


At 7th level, your ability to predict the behaviour of targets increases even further, allowing you to land attacks with unerring accuracy. When performing an accuracy check against the subject of your Analysis, you may use your Intelligence (Logic) modifier, rather than the stated modifier. This only works if the attack effects only the surveyed being.
