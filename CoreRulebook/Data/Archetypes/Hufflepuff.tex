\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Hufflepuff Student}
Hufflepuff House is home to those students who are kind and hard working, as the Sorting\minus{}Song elaborates:
\begin{displayquote}
\it You might belong in Hufflepuff,
\\
Where they are just and loyal,
\\
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true,
\\
And unafraid of toil.
\end{displayquote}
Traditionally seen as ``the other house'', and often mercilessly mocked as such, Hufflepuff is no joke. Certainly,the combination of hard\minus{}work, loyalty and kindness is not something to be sneered at. Even if they are not always the highest achievers, a Hufflepuff Student is someone you would want to have your back in difficult times. Though sometimes timid, they make friends quickly and are often perceptive above what is usual for a student.

\section*{Acquired Feats}


\feat{Token of Loyalty}{Acquired at 1st level, the Token of Loyalty symbolises everything that Hufflepuff House stands for: kindness, dedication, unwavering loyalty and attention to detail. \\~\\
You may use this Token once per day to give yourself check\minus{}advantage on all Perception checks for the next hour.}

\feat{Calming Aura}{At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel the warmth of your spirit into others. \\~\\As a major action, you may lay your hands on an ally and speak comforting words to them. This removes all {\it Terrified}, {\it Confused} or {\it enraged} effects, and any other similar effects. }

\feat{Invaluable Ally}{From 2nd level, your dedication to your friends makes you an important asset to the team. \\~\\ You gain check advantage on spellcasting and accuracy checks on spells cast on your allies. }

\feat{Industrious Attitude}{From 3rd level, you begin to understand why `hard work' is such a central mantra in the Hufflepuff family: as you simply are not happy until the job is done. \\~\\ When faced with a task, you may settle in for the night and get down to business, sacrificing a night's sleep. 
\\~\\
By doing so, you may automatically succeed on any research check (provided the information exists) and learn copius quantities of information about the target, or memorise any spell from your spellbook, bypassing the normal checks required. 
\\~\\
As a penalty, you take two additional levels of {\it Exhaustion}, though you do regain any abilities which require a Long Rest between uses.
