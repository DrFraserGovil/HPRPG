\chapter{Taking Damage}

When you are attacked, or do something stupid, and you fail to either block or dodge the effect (see page \pageref{S:AC}) you must pay the price. This is called `taking damage'. There are different ways for you to take damage, and these have different effects associated with them. 

\subsection{Damage Types}



Many effects specify what kind of damage they do (for instance, a sword does 1d8 slashing damage). This helps the players and the GM work out how the damage is done, and also how it is affected by any weaknesses and resistances possessed by the target. 

{\bf Acid} 

A spray of acid burns through 1cm physical armour to reduce the HP of the being within. 

{\bf Bludgeoning}

The blunt-force of a hammer, or the force of falling on the ground is very difficult to protect against, reducing the HP by a large amount, and risking breaking a bone. 


{\bf Celestial}

A searing white light damages the undead, and banishes the unliving. Has no effect on living beings.  


{\bf Cold}

Cold damage seeps at your willpower, subtracting from FP rather than HP, until FP is zero, at which point it starts leaching HP.  Roll a 1d4, if 1 rolled, acquire Frostbite status. 


{\bf Concussive}

A shockwave from an explosion, passes through physical armour to reduce HP. In addition, target rolls a 1d4, if a 1 is rolled acquire the Deaf status for 3 turns. 

{\bf Electric}

A bolt of lightning can arc from one target to the next, damaging the HP of all it touches. Electric damage can pass through objects and beings which are in contact. 

{\bf Fatigue}

Fatigue damage drains FP from the afflicted. 

{\bf Fire}

Fire damage burns the flesh to reduce the HP. Roll 1d6, 1-2 gives a mild burn, 2-4 gets a moderate burn, 5-6, no effect. 

{\bf Force}

A pure magical energy that directly damages HP. 


{\bf Necrotic}

The evil energies of the undead withers your soul as it damages your body -- reducing HP and FP by equal amounts. 

{\bf Piercing}

Daggers, spears and teeth can puncture even the thickest armour to damage HP. Piercing attacks experience only 50\% the usual armour rating. 

{\bf Poison}

Venemous stings and poisoned weapons damage HP. Roll 1d6, 1-2, mild poisoned status for 3 turns, 3-6, no effect.  

{\bf Psychic}

Damage that originates not from the body, but from the mind. Bypasses all protections to damage HP, and 50\% again to FP. 

{\bf Slashing}

Swinging blades and flashing claws damage the HP of unprotected targets. 


\subsection{Resisting}

Not all effects of actions are cut and dried -- some effects can be {\bf Resisted}. For example, some spells, even after they have successfully been cast, can be resisted by the target, if they have a strong enough willpower to overpower the caster; spells such as {\it confundus}, and {\it stupefy}, as well as most illusion spells. Alternatively, somebody might try to restrain you, and your character can resist this action if they are strong enough. 

Resist actions, like normal checks, are assigned an attribute (and possibly Proficiencies) that may boost the Resist check. Unless otherwise specified, the Resist check is performed using the standard d20 dice. 

This Resist check is then compared with the assigned DV (when resisting spells, or a direct action, this is often the CV of that action). If the Resist check is greater than the CV, then the action is either denied, or has a lesser effect. 

Successfully Resisting costs 2 FP. If you have fewer than 2 FP, then you cannot Resist.

You can perform multiple Resists over the course of a Turn Cycle, if multiple combatants attack you with spells that require one, for example. The only limit is when your FP runs out. However, each subsequent resist gets harder and harder: you suffer a 1 point penalty to your check for each Resist you have already performed this cycle. This counter resets at the end of the cycle.

\section{Statuses}

Statuses are temporary effects applied to a character, usually due to a spell or a magic item, though sometimes mundane objects can confer statuses such as burns. Often these effects come with a built-in time constraint, after which time, the status is removed. It is possible to have more than one status effect at any given time. 

Some statuses come in 3 different levels: mild, moderate and severe; the effects for each are labelled using the notation mild/ moderate / severe: the three levels of burns are indicated to do 1/2/3 damage per turn, meaning that a mild burn does 1 damage per turn, whilst a severe burn does 3. 

A list of statuses is found on the next page.
