\chapter{Taking Damage}

\section{Damage \& Damage Types}

When you are attacked, or do something stupid, you must pay the price. This is called `taking damage'. There are different ways for you to take damage, and these have different effects associated with them. 

Many effects specify what kind of damage they do (for instance, a sword does 1d8 slashing damage). This helps the players and the GM work out how the damage is done, and also how it is affected by any weaknesses and resistances possessed by the target. 

{\bf Acid} 

A spray of acid burns through 1cm physical armour to reduce the HP of the being within. 

{\bf Bludgeoning}

The blunt-force of a hammer, or the force of falling on the ground is very difficult to protect against, reducing the HP by a large amount, and risking breaking a bone. 

{\bf Cold}

Cold damage seeps at your willpower, subtracting from FP rather than HP, until FP is zero, at which point it starts leaching HP.  Roll a 1d4, if 1 rolled, acquire Frostbite status. 


{\bf Concussive}

A shockwave from an explosion, passes through physical armour to reduce HP. In addition, target rolls a 1d4, if a 1 is rolled acquire the Deaf status for 3 turns. 

{\bf Electric}

A bolt of lightning can arc from one target to the next, damaging the HP of all it touches. Electric damage can pass through objects and beings which are in contact. 

{\bf Fatigue}

Fatigue damage drains FP from the afflicted. 

{\bf Fire}

Fire damage burns the flesh to reduce the HP. Roll 1d6, 1-2 gives a mild burn, 2-4 gets a moderate burn, 5-6, no effect. 

{\bf Force}

A pure magical energy that directly damages HP. 


{\bf Holy}

A searing white light damages the undead, and banishes the unliving. Has no effect on living beings.  

{\bf Necrotic}

The evil energies of the undead withers your soul as it damages your body -- reducing HP and FP by equal amounts. 

{\bf Piercing}

Daggers, spears and teeth can puncture even the thickest armour to damage HP. Piercing attacks experience only 50\% the usual armour rating. 

{\bf Poison}

Venemous stings and poisoned weapons damage HP. Roll 1d6, 1-2, mild poisoned status for 3 turns, 3-6, no effect.  

{\bf Psychic}

Damage that originates not from the body, but from the mind. Bypasses all protections to damage HP, and 50\% again to FP. 

{\bf Slashing}

Swinging blades and flashing claws damage the HP of unprotected targets. 

\section{Armour Class}\label{S:AC}

All protective items come with an ``Armour Class'' value (AC). The total AC of a character is given by:

$$\text{AC} = \text{STR modifier + } \sum_\text{clothes} \text{Item AC} + \text{other bonuses}$$	 

Magical defences may serve to raise your AC temporarily. Beasts will also have an AC rating, determined by their inherent magic, and any defensive mechanisms they may posses. 

AC acts to protect your HP from being damaged. If you are about to take damage from any of the following damage types:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Acid
	\item Bludgeoning
	\item Electric
	\item Force
	\item Necrotic
	\item Piercing
	\item Poison
	\item Slashing
\end{itemize}
Then you may subtract away your AC from the damage done (minimum of 0), thus protecting you. Generally speaking, your AC only defends against physical phenomena, and hence does not protect against heat, pyschic and otherworldly damage unless otherwise specified.  Concussive damage produces a shockwave which no AC can protect against. 

\section{Statuses}

Statuses are temporary effects applied to a character, usually due to a spell or a magic item, though sometimes mundane objects can confer statuses such as burns. Often these effects come with a built-in time constraint, after which time, the status is removed. It is possible to have more than one status effect at any given time. 

Some statuses come in 3 different levels: mild, moderate and severe; the effects for each are labelled using the notation mild/ moderate / severe: the three levels of burns are indicated to do 1/2/3 damage per turn, meaning that a mild burn does 1 damage per turn, whilst a severe burn does 3. 

A list of statuses is found on the next page.
