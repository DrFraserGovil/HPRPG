\section{Statuses}

Statuses are effects and conditions which alter a being's capability for the duration of their effect. Statuses can arise as a result of an enemies attack, a magic spell, or from an interaction with the environment. 

The majority of statuses are negative - they impair the character. However, a few statuses such as {\it Invisible} and {\it Calm Mind} are beneficial. 

Most conditions are only temporary, and will wear off after a certain amount of time - or can be ended by a simple character action. Some Statuses, however, are more serious and can only be removed by magical or medical intervention. The effect which causes a status should specify the termination condition, if any. 

A being can be afflicted by multiple statuses at once, and the effects do stack. However, if you have multiple effects which knock you `unconscious', for example, you are not {\it more} unconscious than if you only had the one effect. 

Some Statuses, such as {\it Burned} and {\it Frostbite} do have multiple levels of severity, which are listed as separate statuses.

The full list of Statuses, and the effects they have on a being can be found on page \pageref{S:StatusList}.
