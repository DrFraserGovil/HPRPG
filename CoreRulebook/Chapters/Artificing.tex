\section{Enchanting}
\label{S:Enchanting}
Enchanting is the process whereby magical items are made – imbuing them with extraordinary abilities. 

Unlike `normal' magic, which has gone through the millenia long process of taming, binding and chaining to individual spells, the artificing is still relatively close to its roots as a primordial magic. It is thought that this is probably due to the heavy influence of goblin work in the artificing arts. 

Enchanting an item is achieved through a laborious process of arcane inscription, in which magical runes are drawn over the object to be enchanted using special {\it Runic Tools}. These runes form a complicated web of magic known as the {\it nexus} of the object. If the nexus of an enchanted object is destroyed (an act which normally, though not always, destroys the enchanted object) the enchantment is released. 

Upon completion of the inscription process, a small sealing charm is placed over the object to charge the nexus, at which point it is revealed if the enchantment holds. 

The effect of the enchantment is determined by two things: the runes inscribed on the surface, but also the willpower of the inscriber, which helps shape the otherwise somewhat vague runes. 

There are thousands of individual runes throughout the known world, complex conjugations and combinations, to help guide the mind of the enchanter. All of the runes, however, can be broken down into three categories. For a successful echantment, you need at least one rune from each category to be imbued into the nexus. 

The three categories are the {\bf Duration Runes}, the {\it Action Runes} and the {\it Subject Runes}.

\def\durText{The Duration runes specify how long the effect of the enchanted item lasts after it is activated: does it last for only a few seconds at a time, does it release the effect incredibly quickly then halt, or is the effect permanently active? }

\def\accText{The Action runes specifies the kind of action that the enchantment performs \minus{} does it create something new? Alter what is already present?  Does it give the user new abilities, or does it protect them from harm?}

\def\subText{The Subject runes control what the {\it Action} acts upon. Does the `creation' rune form a blast of fire, a jet of water, or a warm glow of light? }

\section{Potion Making}

Potion making is the art of mixing together ingredients into a magic potion. Potions can have a large variety of effects, from healing the drinker, to causing immense pain, invisibility, or even conferring superhuman good luck. 

To mix a potion requires a number of things:

\begin{itemize}
\item 	A safe place to mix it
\item 	A fire to brew it
\item 	A cauldron to brew it in 
\item 	Between 2 and 5 ingredients
\item 	An empty container to store the potion.
\end{itemize}
