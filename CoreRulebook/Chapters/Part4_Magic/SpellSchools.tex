\chapter{Types of Magic}

Magic is an all-encompassing supernatural force within the universe, with the ability to alter reality at a most basic level. Incredibly powerful and difficult to control, magic is - at its heart - formless, chaotic and without boundaries. 

However, over the centuries, some humans have been born with the ability to touch this immense reservoir of power: witches and wizards. These magic-users have attempted to tame and define magic, and to shepherd into easily understood forms. 

The greatest discovery in wizarding history - comparable to the discovery of fire, or the wheel in the muggle world - was the discovery of the magical spell, followed by the discovery of the magical wand. 

Prior to this discovery, witches and wizards had attempted to harness the infinite force of magic through sheer mental effort. Of course, this meant that a single stray thought at an inopportune moment could lead to blowing up a city, rather than lighting a candle. 

Magical spells however, combine a ritualistic element (usually in the form of an incantation and a physical movement) to condition and focus the mind into the correct shape. The discovery of wands to focus and channel magical energies helped popularise this new way of casting magic - and it is now the utterly dominant way for magical folk to use their skills.  

\section{Spell \& Caster Levels}

Not all spells are created equal - some spells can only be cast by those who are exceptionally skilled in the arcane arts. There are 6 `levels' of spells, which denote how powerful they are:
\begin{center}
\begin{rndtable}{c c p {5.2 cm}}
	\bf Spell Level	&	\bf Name	&	\bf Description
	\\
	1	&	Beginner	&	Basic spells that everyone can cast
	\\
	2	&	Novice		&	More powerful, yet still basic magic
	\\
	3	&	Adept		&	The most powerful magic that a `normal' person uses in their day-to-day life.
	\\
	4	&	Expert		&	Spells which go beyond those learned in a normal education
	\\
	5	&	Master		&	Powerful spells cast by those at the top of their field
	\\
	6	&	Ascendant	&	Nearing god-like abilities
\end{rndtable}
\end{center}

Every witch or wizard has an associated `magic level' as well, which denotes the power of spells that they can cast. A {\it Novice} wizard is able to cast Beginner and Novice-level spells, but no higher. The types of spell a character has access to is determined by the total character level:

\begin{center}
\begin{rndtable}{c c}
	\bf Character Level	&	\bf Spell Level
	\\
	1-3		&	Beginner
	\\
	4-7		&	Novice
	\\
	8-10		&	Adept
	\\
	11-13	&	Expert
	\\
	14-17	&	Master
	\\
	18 + 	&	Ascendant	
\end{rndtable}
\end{center}

\section{Magical Schools}\label{S:Schools}

The study of magic is a far-reaching field, which encompasses many different areas and skills -- some of which require vastly different skillsets to use. For this reason, a magical taxonomy was introduced by the Wizangemot in 1755, which divides the study of magic up into 7 `Schools', each of which contains a number of `Disciplines'. 



	\schoolDescribe{Charms}{The Charms school of magic fundamentally relies on magically manipulating the position and speed of matter, whether on a large scale, to cause objects to levitate and fly - or on a microscopic level, to excite and energise the inside of an object, causing it to burst into flame. \\Those who are proficient in Charms are known as {\it Sorcerers}.}{Elemental}{Elemental magic studies the manipulation and invocation of very primal forces -- heat, light, energy, matter, and the classical elements.}{Kinetic}{Kinetics is a discipline which relies on moving and manipulating physical objects, and often forms the basis of `everyday' magic.}

	\schoolDescribe{Divination}{The Divination school encompasses magic which taps into forces which exist beyond the physical world to discern knowledge that would have previously remained hidden - entering the domain of the senses, memory, and the spiritual realms. }{Cerebral}{Cerebral magic is the study of peering into the human mind, extending the senses beyond their normal range and detecting the undetectable.\\Those who are proficient in the field of Divination are known as {\it Clairvoyants}.}{Temporal}{One of the most mysterious disciplines, temporal magic allows one to see beyond concerns such as time and space, and observe (and perhaps manipulate) the universe at an extraplanar level}
	
	\schoolDescribe{Illusion}{The Illusion school of magic is, as the name might suggest, focussed on magic which produces false images and tweaks the mind into seeing things which are not really there. \\Witches and Wizards who excel in Illusion magics are known as {\it Magicians}. }{Bewitching}{This discipline focusses on the gentle persuasion of the mind and the manipulation and conjuring of images to convince the target of something which is not true.}{Psionic}{A darker side of illusion magics, psionics is the art of imposing your will over that of your target -- forcing your way into their mind and altering it as you see fit.}
	
	\schoolDescribe{Malediction}{The Malediction school of magic contains those spells which have the primary intent to hurt, inflict harm on and otherwise incapacitate others. \\ Those who are experts in the field of Malediction are known as {\it Battlemages}. }{Hexes}{Hexes are a field which focusses on magic that directly harms the targeted person or object.}{Curses}{Unlike hexes, curses do not directly harm the target but instead incapacitates them, inhibits their capabilities, or otherwise reduces the threat they pose.}
   
   \schoolDescribe{Recuperation}{The Recuperation school of magic is often considered unglamourous, but those who can look past that can see that the ability to heal and protect yourself and others from harm is utterly invaluable. \\ Those who are proficient in the use of Recuperation magic are known as {\it Aegistes}. }{Healing}{Healing is, unsurprisingly, the study of magic used to heal the sick and wounded, break curses and project powerful positive energies.}{Warding}{Warding magic is almost entirely defensive in nature, allowing the caster to protect themselves and others from harm by casting powerful and long lasting shields and force-fields.}
	
	\schoolDescribe{Transfiguration}{The Transfiguration school of magic is focused on the transformation of the natural order - either by altering and reshaping the form of existing objects, or by summoning entirely new matter from thin air. \\Those who excel in Transfiguration are known as {\it Thaumaturges}.}{Alteration}{The alteration discipline studies the ability to change things from one form into another.}{Conjuration}{Conjuration magic is concerned with the ability to summon new objects and beings out of thin air, or to banish objects from existence.}
	
	\schoolDescribe{Dark Arts}{The Dark Arts school of magic encompasses magic which is frowned on in polite society, either because it involves truly evil spells - those which cannot be used without leaving scars on the soul, or those which tap into the dangerous and unfathomable energies of the dark and unspeakable things which lie just out of sight - under your bed and in the corner of your eye...\\Those who wield this forbidden magic are known as {\it Warlocks}.}{Necromancy}{A taboo discipline which contains deeply unpleasant spells which can only be cast by beings corrupted by evil - torture, death and worse lie in the domain of necromancy.}{Occultism}{Occultism is a rarely studied discipline that accesses and manipulates otherworldly energies originating from the Eldritch domain -- powerful, yet highly unpredictable.}
