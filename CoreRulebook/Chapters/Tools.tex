A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do with your bare hands -- or even with your wand -- such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Anyone can use a tool, but only someone who is proficient in it will be able to use a tool to its full potential. Proficiency in a tool is granted through Racial or Archetype abilities, or by taking the Tool-User Skill. 

A common list of tools is presented below:
