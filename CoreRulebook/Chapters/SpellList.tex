\chapter{Spell List} \label{S:SpellList}

This section contains a list of all the spells available in the game. First, the spells are presented broken down into the school and level to which they belong. The next section then contains a full description of the spell, including its casting check, casting difficulty, and spell effects. Spells marked with a (*) gain more effects, or increase in power, at higher levels.
