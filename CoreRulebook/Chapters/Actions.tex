\chapter{Performing Checks}


In general, when you want to perform an action, simply tell the GM what you wish to do. 

If it is a simple action – for example, “I walk to the shop”, then the action is completed with no further involvement. More complex actions may require a ‘check’ to be performed, to determine their success: inform the GM of what you want to do, and the GM will tell you what check to perform. 

Usually, every action you wish to perform falls into the domain of one of your 8 character attributes (where there is ambiguity, the GM's word is final). The a check to jump over a ravine, for example, would be an Athletics check, whilst a check to remember the ingredients of a potion would be an Intelligence check. Having a higher attribute score in the relevant field will make your check more likely to succeed. 

Below is a rough guide as to the kind of actions that each attribute governs: 

\begin{tabular}{l p{7cm} }
    {\bf Athletics}: & Governs physical feats: running, jumping, and swimming, as well as melee attacks
    \\~\\ {\bf Finesse}: 	& Actions that require precision and control, such as aiming, stealth and pickpocketing.
   \\~\\   {\bf Spirit}: &	Feats that require concentration, force of will and the ability to endure hardship.
    \\~\\  {\bf Charisma}:& 	Convincing and persuading others, haggling and distractions. 
    \\~\\  {\bf Intelligence}: &	Research, knowledge and memory actions. 
    \\~\\  {\bf Perception}:&	Noticing things: either as a general spatial awareness, or differences in an individual
    \\~\\  {\bf Power}:& 	Used for feats of great magical strength 
    \\~\\  {\bf Evil}: &	Used to commit atrocities and spread chaos. 
\end{tabular}

On top of these general actions, casting magic spells requires abilities in each of these fields. Each spell `discipline' is assocoiated with an attribute. Therefore casting Hexes, for example, requires a SPR check, but casting an illusion requires you to be convincing, using a CHR check. 

As always, the GM has the authority to override these general guidelines, if it is suitable to do so. For more detail on how to calculate a check, see page \pageref{S:Checks}.

\section{Success \& Failure}

After having performed a check (the details of which are discussed below), you will end up with a single number -- a result of the (usually) d20 dice, modifiers, proficiencies and any other bonuses. It is now time to `resolve' the check, and decide if the action was successful or not. 

Generally speaking, the following table gives a rough outline of the check required to pass actions of a certain difficulty:
\begin{center}
\begin{rndtable}{|c p{3cm} c|}
\hline
Task Difficulty & 	Description & Required Check	
\\ \hline 
Very Easy & \parbox[t]{3cm}{\raggedright An everyday task that anyone could be expected to carry out first time.}	&	5
\\
Easy & \parbox[t]{3cm}{\raggedright A simple task that has only a small chance of failure.}& 10
\\
Moderate & \parbox[t]{3cm}{\raggedright A task that a normal person might require a few tries to get right} & 15
\\
Hard & \parbox[t]{3cm}{\raggedright A task that a normal person could not carry out without specialist training} &20
\\
Very Hard & \parbox[t]{3cm}{\raggedright A task that even a trained expert might struggle to complete. } & 25
\\
Legendary & \parbox[t]{3cm}{\raggedright A task that perhaps one person alive could actually complete.}	& 30
\\ \hline
\end{rndtable}
\end{center}

It is up to the GM to decide the difficulty of the task (they do not need to reveal this to you), and they may of course deviate from this table. 

If the check succeeds, then the action goes ahead -- if not, then the action fails, and there may be negative consequences, especially if the dice roll was a 1 (`natural failure'), or if your modifiers are such that the check was negative (haha). If this happens, the GM may come up with a suitable back-firing, or you may alert enemies to your presence, and so on. 

On the other hand, many GM's accept that a check which rolls a 20 on the d20 (`nat 20'), if the action succeeds, is said to be a `critical success', and may have positive effects beyond the intended. If the check was an attack, for instance, it may be considered a critical strike (see below), and do extra damage. 


\newpage

\section{Dice}

In general, you will use the 20 sided dice (d20) as the basis of all checks. You roll this dice once, and use the first value. 

There are two notable exceptions to this general rule: {\bf spellcasting checks}(used to determine if a witch or wizard managed to cast a given spell) and {\bf damage checks}(used to determine how much damage a given attack or event inflicted) often use dice other than a d20. Read more about this in the relevant chapters.  

If the value of a dice is roll indeterminate, or the dice falls off the table, it is usually best to perform the check again: though you may form your own conventions as to the etiquette in such situations.

\section{Modifiers}

After having performed the dice roll, you then modify the value by the various bonuses that your character has. 

The primary way to do this is through using the {\it attribute modifiers}. These are 8 values associated with each of your 8 attribute scores. When asked to perform a check associated with, for example, the Athletics attribute, you add your Athletics modifier on to the d20 check. 

The modifier is calculated using the following formula:
$$ \text{attribute modifier} = \frac{\text{attribute value} - 10}{2} \text{ (rounded down)} $$
The result of this formula for the usual range of values is listed below: 
 
\begin{center}
\begin{rndtable}{|c c p{0.1cm} c c|}
\hline \bf Value 	&\bf 	Modifier  & ~ & \bf Value & \bf Modifier
\\ \hline
0-1	&	-5		&	~	&	10-11	&	+ 0
\\
2-3	&	-4	&	~	&	12-13	&	+ 1
\\	
4-5	& 	-3	&	~	&	14-15	&	+ 2
\\
6-7	&	-2		&	~	&	16-17&		+ 3
\\
8-9	&	-1		&	~	&	18-19	&	+4
\\
\hline
\end{rndtable}
\end{center}

Given that an attribute value of 10 is considered `average', the attribute modifier is a way of quantifying ``how much better than average are you at this specific skill?"

For example, a Level 5 Auror wants to try and convince a ne'er-do-well to reveal the location of their boss. The GM directs her to perform a Charisma check to convince the target. The auror has a charisma value of 15, which corresponds to a +2 bonus. After rolling a 12, the total value for the check is 14, which the GM reveals was insufficient to persuade the target. 

\newpage
\section{Expertise \& Proficiencies}

\subsection{Expertise Bonus}
As a character grows and learns, they find certain skills that they excel in. The base level of expertise in the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot is significantly larger than that of a first year Hogwarts student. When faced with a check in a field in which you are an expert, you are significantly more likely to succeed. 

This is quantified through your {\it Expertise Bonus}.  This is a single number that you may add to checks in areas which you are considered {\it proficient} in. For most characters, the proficiency is calculated from your total character level in the following fashion:
$$ \text{Expertise bonus} = \frac{\text{Character Level}}{4} + 2 ~~~\text{(rounded down)}$$
Some Archetypes, however, grant extra expertise bonus, and as such, deviate from this formua. The table representing each class-overview gives the Expertise bonus that class has at a given level. 

\subsection{Attribute Proficiencies}
The 8 attributes are further subdivided into 19 individual proficiencies. A characer usually gains proficiencies through advancement in their Archetype. These proficiencies goven subdomains within the larger attribute. For example, a powerlifter and a sprinter are both very Athletic individuals, and would have a high ATH score. However, they are athleticin very different ways: the powerlifter has the {\it Strength} proficiency and the sprinter the {\it Speed} one.

The full list of proficiencies is as follows:
%\setlength{\columnsep}{-1cm}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin = 0.2cm]
{\raggedright  \footnotesize
	\item ATH

			\item {\bf Chaos}
			 {\footnotesize \it Gain a bonus when spreading wanton destruction and chaos}
			\item {\bf Intimidation}
			{\footnotesize \it Scare others, and make them more likely to give you want you want}
		\end{itemize}
		}
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
\setlength{\columnsep}{0.7cm}


If the GM decides that an action falls under one of these categories, they may ask for, rather than a simple ``ATH check'', an ``ATH (strength) check'' in order for a character to lift a log, or an ``ATH (speed) check'' in order for the character to run away from danger. 

If your character is considered proficient in this field, then in addition to the ATH modifier, one may also add your Expertise bonus in to the check calculation to represent your character's significantly above-average skills in this field. If you do not have proficiency in the given field, you are not `punished' and must simply use your normal modifier without the additional bonus. 

In the previous example, our Level 5 auror (with 15 Charisma) rolled a 12 to try and convince a perp to talk, elevated to 14 with the +2 CHR modifier. This was insufficient to persuade the target to talk. However, if she had been proficient in the {\it persuade} subdomain, she could add her Expertise bonus (+3 for a lvl 5 character), giving a total value of 17 -- surely enough to convince anyone to talk! 


\subsubsection{Unusual Uses}

Generally speaking, proficiency bonuses will always be associated with the attribute listed above -- so Speed will usually be added on to an ATH check. However, in certain circumstances it makes sense to cross the borders. For example, if you are threatening to beat someone up, you might use an ``ATH (intimidation)'' check, or a ``POW (intimidation)'' if you are threatening them with magical violence -- even though Intimidation is an EVL proficiency. 

The GM decides what is appropriate for each moment. 

You are always allowed to ask the GM if a proficiency applies to a specific check, even if the proficiency was not explicitly asked for -- but they are always within their rights to refuse!

\subsection{Other Proficiencies}

In addition to the proficiencies associated with attributes, you may also be considered proficient in the use of various classes of weapons, and special tools. There are also some proficiencies with unusual or more nebulous domains-- for example the {\it Muggle-Lover} skill grants you proficiency in muggle-related checks, and archetypes often grant proficiency in certain spell disciplines.  

As with the attribute-proficiencies, being proficient in an area means that you may add your Expertise bonus to the associated checks. 

Weapon-proficiencies explicitly allow you to add he bonus to the {\it accuracy} check, not to the damage check. Some tools also give additional abilities with proficiency in them, as stated in the item description.

\subsection{Multiple Proficiencies} 

Occasionally, you may encounter scenarios where you may apply your Expertise bonus multiple times. For example, a character with both the {\it Muggle-Lover} skill and the {\it persuasion} proficiency attempts to persuade a muggle of something. However, you may only add your Expertise bonus once per check, unless a mechanic explicitly mentions that the bonus is doubled, or halved. 

\section{Check Advantage}

If you have the status effect {\it Check Advantage}, or are otherwise granted this ability on certain checks, then you may perform checks twice -- and take the largest value. This decreases the likelihood of a negative outcome, and increases the likelihood of a positive one. 

Conversely, a {\it Check Disadvantage} requires you to perform a check twice and take the lower of the two values. 

You may sometimes have a conflict of multiple check modifiers such as this. The GM has the ability to rule that they either cancel each other out or (in rare instances) compound each other to give {\it check double-advantage} or {\it check double-disadvantage}, in which case you must perform the check three times, rather than twice. There is no check triple-(dis)advantage.


\section{Working Together}

Occasionally two or more characters might decide that, together, they have a better chance of succeeding in a given task, and can work together. A character may only help if they could perform the action themselves (so you could only help pick a lock if you also had proficiency in lockpicking tools), or if you can provide a reasonable justification for how you are helping the action succeed (an engineer attempting to fix an engine could use somebody to hand them tools, for example). 

When working together like this, the character with the highest relevant modifier performs the check with check-advantage. 

Sometimes, you might need to complete a task where the entire group needs to succeed, but the group may help each other -- for example, if the entire group needs to jump across a ravine, or if the entire group is searching for a single hidden item. The GM may decided on the most appropriate course of action, but a general first-start is to ask all members of the group to perform the check -- if at least half of the group succeed, the entire group succeeds. 


\section{Multiple Attempts}

Sometimes, after an action fails, a character may want to try again immediately. This is generally to be discouraged - it makes the game less fun if everyone is just waiting for Mike to (finally) roll a 20. 

A general rule is that you can't repeat an action until there is a material change in circumstance that might alter the outcome. This doesn't usually apply in combat as, you are sacrificing your other combat actions each turn cycle to try anew. 

Of course, the GM may make allowances for multiple attempts. This will most commonly occur if you have some finite resource that you are burning through. If you only have 3 fragile lockpicks, there's no particular harm in giving you 3 attempts at opening the door. 

If, however, a character is attempting to `spam' a check -- i.e. just keep rolling the dice until they succeed, and it makes enough narrative sense that the GM doesn't overrule it, then they instead ask you to roll a d100 on the table found on page \pageref{S:Multi}, which will determine the number of failed attempts.
