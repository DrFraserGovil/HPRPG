\section{Changes in V4.0$\beta$}

\subsection{Changes to Artificing}

An entirely new artificing system was introduced, both for enchanting and potion making. 

Artificing is now made up of a rune-based enchanting system riffed from Ars Magica, and an ingredient-plus-flair alchemy system. 

\subsection{Spellcasting Changes}

\begin{itemize}
	\item A drastic overhaul to the spellcasting system. 
	\item Dice no longer increase in size: spellcasting is a d20 skill, with the DV changing
	\item The associated `magic skills' have been removed. 
	\item Power Points have been removed, and a 5e style `upcasting' system implemented to replace it. 
	\item Spell Schools split into 2 disciplines each with the spellcasting skill set by the discipline
	\item FP costs fixed on a per-level basis
	\item Spell Resist DVs set by a `subjugation' value which increases with Power. 
	\item Focus spell mechanic changed
	\item Casting checks now only need to be performed for non-memorised spells. 
	\item Some spells have an accuracy check associated with them. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Changes to Character Attributes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Empathy renamed to Perception (better gameplay mechanic)
	\item Athletics renamed to Fitness (to encompass the general physical health aspect)
	\item Finesse changed to Precision (simply because FIT and FIN were too similar!)
	\item The Attribute proficiencies have been shifted around and a few new ones renamed. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dodge, Block and Accuracy}

\begin{itemize}
	\item A new accuracy system has been implemented
	\item Single (bad) AC-style system was changed into the {\it Instinct} system.
	\item {\it Dodge} is your ability to dodge out of the way, bolstered by the {\it Evade} action.
	\item {\it Block} is your ability to deflect or absorb an attack, bolstered by the {\it Brace} action. 
	\item The bolstering actions also improve your Resist scores, so Resist-spells cannot totally overpower a being. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{New Action Mechanics}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The {\it Evade} and {\it Brace} minor actions were introduced in line with the AC overhaul
	\item Rules for Group checks and assistance were introduced. 
	\item A multiple-attempt table was added on page \pageref{S:Multi} to rapid iteration of attempts. 
	\item The `non-combat' section has been revamped and called `everyday actions', including rules for swimming, climbing, social actions and downtime
	\item Added cover and blindfighting rules 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Archetypes}

The changes enumerated elsewhere in this section required a total overhaul of the Archetype system.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The alpha/beta branch system has been removed as overwrought and unfun
	\item The Student House Archetypes have been reduced to 3 levels each 
	\item The classes have been altered to the following list:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 4 House Archetypes (unchanged)
		\item Acolyte
		\item Artificer
		\item Berserker
		\item Druid
		\item Healer
		\item Outlaw
		\item Recluse
		\item Scholar
		\item Spellsinger
		\item Warrior
	\end{itemize}
	\item Of these, the following have been completed:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 4 House Archetypes
		\item Artificer
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expertise}

Previously called `Arcane Wisdom', the Expertise mechanics has been brought in as a similar device to the DnD 5e `proficiency bonus'. Previously, I was trying to do something different for the sake of being different. But why fix what isn't broken?

\subsubsection{Proficiencies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Previously, proficiencies were treated as additional bonuses, each with their own numerical score. In line with the Expertise mechanic being brought in, they are instead replaced with checkboxes: you add your proficiency bonus to related checks, rather than having individual values associated with each. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Spell Changes}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Spell damage reworked and balanced slightly (`cvdv' spells, which increased as your casting check increased, have been removed)
	\item Some spells have shifted schools as the discipline system made it more obvious where they lay. 
	\item Some renaming: `Hexes and Curses' became `Malediction'. 
	\item A large number of new spells, at all levels, have been added. 
	\item Almost all spells have had their effects `tweaked' slightly in order to balance them. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Cheat Sheet}

A `cheat sheet' has been added, allowing for a simple printout to serve as a reference for nearly all spellcasting. 



\subsection{Item Changes}


\begin{itemize}
	\item The actual Harry Potter currency system has been implemented - \knut{29}to \sickle{1}, \sickle{17} to \galleon{1}. I fixed the value of \galleon{1} at Â£50. 
	\item Most items had their prices adjusted + fitted into this new scheme. A few outliers are still using the old system.
	\item Weapons were overhauled
	\item A new + better armour system has been put in place. 
	
\end{itemize}
