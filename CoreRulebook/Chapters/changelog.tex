\section{Changes in V4.0$\beta$}

\subsection{Changes to the Spellcasting System}

\subsubsection{Spell Damage Reworked}

``cvdv" spells (i.e. those who did more damage when a casting check exceeded the DV by a higher amount) have been replaced by equivalent spells with standard ndx damage checks. This stabilises spell effects + balances the system better than before. 

\subsubsection{General effect balancing}

Spell effects were quantified across levels, and were balanced to ensure that lower level spells remain relevant at higher levels, but do not outclass their higher level compatriots. 

\subsubsection{Power Point Refocus}

Previous iterations relied on drastic changes to spell effects at higher levels (i.e. switching out damage-causing dice at higher levels). This not only required strict adherence to the spelllist page, it also led to unbalanced spells and a discontinous power slope (cheap spells suddenly gained significant power without commeasurate increases in DV/FP). 

This flaw was fixed by altering these spells to use the Power Point system introduced in V1 but poorly utilised. This integrates with the effect balancing: it allows spells to gradually gain power whilst also increasing the costs of that spell. 

\subsubsection{Disciplines Introduced}

The introduction of the 14 Spell Disciplines and the associated fixed check-type for each of them removes the need for each spell to have a DV/checktype listed. It therefore streamlines gameplay by removing the need for constant pageflipping, and simplifies the magic system. It also synergises well with the bimodal nature many of the Schools already possessed (i.e. `Hexes \& Curses', `Healing \& Warding') in previous editions. 

\subsubsection{Some Renaming}

Some small things changed names.

`Hexes and Curses' spell school became `Malediction'. 

`Concentration' spell types became `Focus' (this was purely for aesthetic / space saving reasons!)

\subsubsection{Cheat Sheet}

The `cheat sheet' has been added, allowing for a simple printout to serve as a reference for nearly all spellcasting. 

\subsubsection{Manipulate Spells}

It was felt that the `manipulate' spells were badly done, and were either overpowered (when considered a Novice or Adept spell), or held back simple manipulation abilities until too late in the game (when considered an Expert or Master spell). Therefore 20 new spells: 5 for each of the 4 classical elements were added in a successive manner. This hopefully provides a more integrated and flexible experience for the budding benders out there. 

\subsubsection{Spells alterations}

The following spells have been added:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Control Air/Earth/Fire/Water 1/2/3/4/5 (20 Elemental spells)
	
	See above for the justification for these additions

\end{itemize}

	This spell becaeme redundant with the improved Control spells
	
	\item Manipulate Earth/Air/Fire/Water
	
	(As above)
	
	\item Summon Weak/Capable Avatar
	
	Too skyrim-y! This is part of the removal of the three-tiered system implemented for many creatures in V1.0
\end{itemize}

The following spells have been changed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Flame Dart was renamed Ignite Being. 
\end{itemize}
(Almost all damage-causing spells had their effects altered as part of previously mentioned rebalancing, and are not listed here)


\subsection{Changes to Items}

\subsubsection{Prices}

More realistic prices were added to the basic items and artefacts lists. 


\subsection{Evasion/AC System Revamp}

\subsubsection{Overhaul}

The AC/Dodging system was overhauled. Now exists in a hybrid state between 5e and the old system. I like it better this way. AC was always abstract, this gives a better sense of what is going on, and gives a way to tradeoff between dodging and heavy armour. 

\subsubsection{Character Sheet}

The character sheet was altered to include room for an accuracy, a dodge and a block attriubute.

\subsection{Meta-Changes}

A meta-change: this changelog was included!


\section{To-Do List}

\subsection{Rethink Perception}

THe EMP/ Perception balance feels off. Maybe rename EMP to PER and reconfigure some of EMP into CHA? 

\subsection{Rethink AC}

Split AC up into a `dodge' part and a `brace' part? 

Dodge: 6+FIN modifier + bonuses 
Block: 6+ATH modifier + bonuses

On a normal attack, melee and ranged attacks (inc. spells) perform an accuracy check (d20 + bonuses), DV = highest of dodge, block. 

Can choose to Dodge or Block
