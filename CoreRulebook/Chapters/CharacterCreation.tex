\chapter{Creating A Character}

The first step in playing the game is to create your own character. Your character can be whatever or whoever you want it to be -- this is your story after all. 

Your character is manifest in the game through your imagination, but in order to quantify the events occurng in the story, a character is formed from a mixture of several ingredients (of which imagination is a non-trivial part!), from which we can generate statistics and check values. 

Before you begin, it is helpful if you have an idea of the kind of character you wish to create -- your GM should tell you the rough outlines of the setting, which should help guide the type of character that will work well in the story. Do you want to play a powerfully destructive mage bent on crushing their enemies; or an investigator, pursuing the truth behind a mystery? 

You should also think about the backstory of your character -- what has led them to this point in their lives? Why are they going on this adventure?  

Once you have a good idea of the kind of character you wish to create, follow these steps to generate you character, and record the results on the Character Sheet.

\subsubsection*{1) Choose a (sub)Species}

Every character belongs to one of the Sapient races present in this world -- be they a human, a goblin, or a centaur. Some of the species (notably the humans) have several "sub-species" which take into account variation within the species. 

Belonging to a species confers your most basic characteristics: what do you look like? What magics -- if any -- do you have access to? 

Some species will also find themselves having a natural aptitude for certain skills, so it can be useful to think about how best to pair up your species and archetypes. The species available, and the abilities that they possess are discussed in Chapter \ref{C:Species}

\subsubsection*{2) Choose an Archetype}

An archetype broadly defines what your character does for a living -- but it is also much more than that. The archetype defines what role your character plays in the story, how they perceieve and interact with others and (perhaps more importantly) what skills they can develop as they progress. 

Your character recieves new skills and abilities by virtue of their archetype, so look ahead and see which skills you think will be the most useful (or, the most fun!) to develop along with your character. Archetypes are discussed in detail in Chapter \ref{C:Archetype} 

\subsubsection*{3) Determine Attribute Scores}

The 8 Attributes and 20 associated Proficiencies will be your main numerical way of interacting with the game world. These numbers encode your characters abilities. Your class and archetype will probably already have given your characters some abilities in this area, but all characters then get a choice of how to allocate some additional points. 

A low score in a given attribute will have a long-term effects on your character's abilities (though they can develop with time), so think carefully about how your abilities mesh with your character's personality and archetype. A particularly shy character, you might decide, will not be very brave, and thus will have a low Willpower. Attributes are discussed in more detail in Chapter \ref{C:Attributes}

\subsubsection*{4) Gather Your Equipment}

Your character will probably gain some supplies by virtue of their archetype, but you will also acquire some cash, as well as perhaps the most important item in your inventory: your wand. The item system is presented in chapter \ref{C:Items}.

\subsubsection*{5) Go adventuring!}

At this point, you will hopefully have a fully formed character, possibly working within a party of other characters. 

You will now be ready to set of on your adventure!

\chapter{Playable Species} \label{C:Species}
 
 Different magical races have different characteristics, abilities, and affinities with different kinds of magic. Each choice of race/species modifies your attribute values by a set amount and provides a pool of extra points which you can allocate to attributes at will, and some race-specific Abilities and Skills. 
 
It is generally impossible to switch species once a character has been created, except where it makes sense within the story (i.e. a human transitioning to a Vampire after being bitten).

\chapter{Main Attributes}\label{C:Attributes}

Attributes are the defining characteristics of your character. They enumerate how strong willed, how athletic and how popular your character is. These characteristics in turn define how good your character is at certain skills -- a character with a large willpower, for instance, will be good at combat magic, whilst a character with a low \attPhys{} would find themselves unable to run away from threats!

\newcommand\attLine[3]

\begin{tabular}{r l}

	\attLine{\attPhys{}}{\attPhysShort{}}{ The measure of the physical capabilities of a character, as well as their general health. }

	\attLine{ \attFin{}}{\attFinShort{}}{A being's ability to execute actions with delicacy and precision. Picking pockets, hiding and ranged attacks require finesse to execute properly. }

	\attLine{\attSpr{}} {\attSprShort{}} {The internal strength, bravery and conviction of a being. Typically considered the defining characteristic of Gryffindor House. }

    \attLine{\attPer{}}{\attPerShort{}}{ Awareness of the world outside a being's own head -- spotting a hidden tripwire, or the detection of other's emotions. Often going hand in hand with a kind and compassionate soul, perception is considered the defining trait of Hufflepuff House. }

\end{tabular}
	
In addition to these 8 high-level attributes, there exist a number of specialised domains within most of them. These are known as {\it Proficiencies}. These, along with a more in-depth discussion of the actions associated with each of the attributes, are discussed in more detail on page \pageref{S:Proficiencies}.


 \subsection*{Determining Abilities}
 
Perhaps the most important part of Character Creation is determining the attributes of your character. This is done by rolling a 2d6+2 ten times. This gives you 10 numbers between 4 and 14. You may then allocate 7 of these numbers to your non-EVL attributes at will. EVL defaults to zero at character creation. 
 
Generally speaking, you will want to allocate the largest of these values to the attributes which your character will rely on the most -- so a powerful magical warrior will get the largest values allotted to SPR and POW, whilst a seer would get larger values dedicated to PER. 
 

 \section{Health \& Fortitude}
 
 Having determined your character's baseline attributes, we may now begin to see how this affects values relevant to gameplay -- namely, the Health and Fortitue of your character.
 
 \subsection*{Health}
 
Health is the physical status of your character: attacking a character lowers their health, and when the health points (HP) of a character reach zero, that character tacquires the {\it Critical Condition} status. If this is not rectified quickly, the character will quickly perish. 

There are three statistics associated with your Health: your {\it Current Health}, your {\it Maximum Health} and {\it Temporary Health}. 

The current health is enumerated through your Health Points (also known as Hit Points), this is a number between 0 and (usually) your Maximum Health statistic, which is the maximum amount of health and vitality that a being intrinsically possesses. You lose HP when you take damage, and regain it when you heal, either naturally or through magical or mundane medicine. 

You may also occasionally encounter effects which give temporary boosts to your maximum health, which is sorted into {\it Temporary Health}. Your HP may only ever exceed your Maximum Health when you are under the effect of such an effect.
Your HP is therefore always limited to be between 0 and the sum of your maximum health and your temporary health. 

If an effect which provides you with temporary health wears off whilst your HP exceeds your maximum health, you must reduce your HP to satisfy the current HP ceiling. However, with most effects, if your HP is below the ceiling, then you do not alter your HP when your ceiling falls. 

Your maximum health points are determined by your character archetype - each archetype gives a starting max HP, and then an amount by which to increase it each level. In addition, if you possess the {\it Vitality} proficiency, your health increases more rapidly by giving you check-advantage on HP-increasing rolls.

\subsection*{Fortitude}

Fortitude is a character{\apos}s ability to concentrate, which is necessary to cast spells and other feats or great mental prowess. Such actions take effort, and a character{\apos}s fortitude points (FP) will be slowly eroded by engaging in such mental effort.  

When your FP reaches zero, your mind is exhausted, and so you will no longer be able to engage in such complex actions. Some effects which previously effected only your Fortitude will begin to effect your health

As with health, you have three statistics associated with fortitude: {\it Current Fortitude}, {\it Maximum Fortitude}, {\it Temporary Fortitude}. These follow the same rules as their Health counterparts. 

The Maximum Fortitude is, as with HP, grown in conjunction with your Archetype. If you possess the {\it Logic} proficiency, your mind can be trained me easily, giving you check-advantage on FP-increasing rolls.





\subsection{Natural Healing}

Characters naturally regenerate both FP and HP over time. 

HP regenerates slowly as minor wounds heal, at a rate of around 2HP per hour whilst not in combat (unless there is a status effect blocking the healing effect), increasing to d10 per hour when asleep or resting. If you sleep for more than 8 hours, your HP is considered fully restored. However, status effects such as Serious Wound may impact the maximum HP which can be reached by natural healing, without external intervention. 

FP regenerates much faster, and can do so even whilst under fire. In combat, you recover 2FP per turn cycle in which you do not expend FP. Outside of combat, FP regenerates at a rate of 5FP per minute. However, status effects such as {\it Fatigue} can slow, or even entirely halt, FP regeneration. 

\section{Other Statistics}

In addition to your HP and FP, there are a number of other statistics that impact your character and control how they interact with the world. 

These statistic include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Base Speed} 
	
	This is determined by your choice of species and the {\it Mobile} skill. Determines how fast you move in combat
	
	\item {\bf Proficiencies}
	
	In addition to the proficiencies mention above, you also may want to keep track of the weapons and tools you are considered proficient in. 
	
	\item {\bf Block}
	
	One of two {\it Instincts} used to set the DV of accuracy checks. Value set to 10 + \attPhys{} modifier.
	
	\item {\bf Dodge}
	
	The other {\it Instinct}. Value is 10 + \attFin{} modifier.
	
	\item {\bf Spellcasting Bonuses}
	
	Wizards have different abilities in each of the schools of magic, and their associated Disciplines. You need to keep track of your abilities in this field. 
	
	\item {\bf Spell Power}
	
	Determines the DV of resist checks for spells that you cast. Value is 8 + Expertise bonus + POW modifier. 
\end{itemize}

The useage of these statistics, and the role they play in the game, is discussed in more detail in the relevant sections below.
