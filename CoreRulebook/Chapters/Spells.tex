\section{Magical Schools}

The study of magic is a far-reaching field, which encompasses many different areas and skills -- some of which require vastly different skillsets to use. For this reason, a magical taxonomy was introduced by the Wizangemot in 1755, which divides the study of magic up into 7 `Schools', each of which contains a number of `Disciplines'.

	\school{Divination}{Telepathy}{Telepathic magic is the study of the human mind, and that which extends the senses.}{Temporal}{One of the most mysterious disciplines, temporal magic allows one to see beyond concerns such as time and space, and observe (and perhaps manipulate) the universe at an extraplanar level}
	\\
	\school{Illusion}{Bewitchment}{This discipline focusses on the gentle persuasion of the mind and the manipulation of images to convince the target of something which is not true.}{Psionics}{A darker side of illusion magics, psionics is the art of imposing your will over that of your target -- an act which usually shatters their sanity.}
	\\
	\school{Malediction}{Hexes}{Hexes are a field which focusses on magic that directly harms the targeted person or object.}{Curses}{Unlike hexes, curses do not directly harm the target but instead incapacitates them, inhibits their capabilities, or otherwise reduces the threat they pose.}
   \\ 
   \school{Recuperation}{Healing}{Healing is, unsurprisingly, the study of magic used to heal the sick and wounded.}{Warding}{Warding magic is almost entirely defensive in nature, allowing the caster to protect themselves and others from harm.}
	\\

Every spell is assigned to be a member of one of these disciplines, which determines the skills that are necessary to cast it.

\section{Spell Types} 

In addition to falling into one of the seven Schools (a taxonomy based on the spell effect), every spell can also be categorised as a {\it type}, which is based on how the spell is cast. These categories are {\it instant}, {\it concentration}, {\it ritual} and {\it ward} spells. 

\subsection{Instant}

An instant spell is cast as a single major action, and is `cast and forget': as soon as you complete the requisite casting check, the spell is `launched' (usually in the form of a magical bolt of light) towards the target. These bolts travel at speeds of 100m per cycle, corresponding to about 40mph. This means that, unless the target is at ane extreme range, the effect is applied between the major action phase and the beginning of the next turn.

\subsection{Concentration}

A concentration spell is cast like an Instant spell, but may then be continued indefinitely, repeating the initial effects once per turn as long as you keep the spell active. No further checks are needed to continue the spell, but you must remain focussed and unless stated otherwise, the FP cost is deducted once per turn as well.

Because you must remain focussed, no further spells can be cast for the duration of this spell, and all subsequent movement checks must be `considered', and no other actions (such as evasion) may be taken.   

If you take damage whilst casting a concentration spell, you must pass a d20 SPR(willpower) check (DV 10) in order to remain casting. In addition, all attacks on you are considered {\it Attacks of Opportunity} (see page \pageref{S:Sneak}). You may, however, end the spell effect at any time without it counting as an action. 


\subsection{Ward}
A ward is (usually) a Recuperation spell that affects a large area. A ward may be centred on a fixed point or object, or may be centred on a moving location or even a sentient being. 

Wards, however, have an unfortunate habit of interfering with each other when used in unison. If two wards have a significant overlapping region of effect and the caster does not have the {\it Multiward} skill or an equivalent feat, there is a significant chance (determined by the GM) that both wards will collapse. 

The interference only applies if the wards are similar in magnitude and intent. For example, Hogwarts castle is a heavily warded region, but a small ward could be placed in a room without problem. Interference would only become a problem when a new castle-wide ward was attempted. 

Equally, intereference only applies if the effects of the ward compound each other -- if they lie in opposition, then the usual spell mechanics are applied. For example, a character with a personal shield ward touches a beartrap ward -- neither ward collapses, but the beartrap ward is triggered, and the shield will attempt to protect the character. 

\subsection{Ritual}

A Ritual spell is a spell that requires a large amount of preparation -- be it meditation, drawing a summoning circle upon the ground, or performing a special dance. Each Ritual spell has a deisgnated time that the ritual takes to complete, to cast a ritual spell you must spend this length of time preparing for the spell, and after the requisite time has passed, {\it then} you perform the check, and the spell effect is activated. If you fail the check, or choose to stop the ritual, i.e. to take another action, you must restart the ritual spell from the beginning. 

As with a concentration spell, focus is key to completing a ritual. If you are interrupted during the preparation phase, it is considered an {\it Attack of Opportunity} and you must pass a DV10 SPR(willpower) check in order to continue.

\section{Casting Spells}


All spells are cast by performing a `check' -- rolling a dice, and then adding on the associated skill modifiers and bonuses that apply for that spell, and comparing it to the Difficulty Value (DV) for the spell. If the Casting Check (CC) is greater than or equal to the DV and you have enough FP, then the spell is considered to be cast, and the effects are applied.  

When performing the check, you use a die of a size commensurate to your ability in that school of magic. As you become a more proficient magic-user, you get access to bigger dice, which enables you to cast more powerful spells, and increases the success rate and power of lower-level spells. 

\begin{center}
	\begin{rndtable}{|c c c|}

	\bf Level & \bf  Name & \bf Die
	\\ 
	1 & Beginner & 1d6
	\\
	2 & Novice & 1d8
	\\
	3 & Adept & 1d10 (with 0 = 10)
	\\
	4 & Expert & 1d12
	\\
	5 & Master & 1d20
	\\ \hline
	\end{rndtable}
\end{center}

The size of dice you are allowed to use is determined on a school-by-school basis via the relevant skills discussed on page \pageref{S:Skills}.

\subsection{Spellbooks and Memory} \label{S:Memory}

There are two ways to cast a spell -- either by reading it from the pages of a book, or by being familiar enough with the spell that you can cast it from memory. 

For each of the 7 schools of magic, there are 5 textbooks. Each of these 35 textbooks is associated with a spell-level and a school, and contains all the spells in that school for that level. For example, the book {\it Dark Forces: A Guide to Self Protection} is a level 4 Hexes \& Curses book, and so contains all level level 4 Hexes \& Curses, but {\bf not} the 3rd level spells, for example. 

To cast a spell from a book, you must be holding a book which contains the specified spell in one hand, and your wand in another. You must then perform the checks, and the spell will be cast. Casting like this takes twice as long as normal, often has a higher casting check and fortitude cost associated with it, and you are open to {\it Attacks of Opportunity} when doing this in combat. Swapping books takes a minor action. 

If, however, you become familiar with a spell, then it is no longer necessary to have the book in your possession -- you can cast from memory. Spells cast from memory are almost always superior, and may be used as quickcast actions etc. Memory-casting is considered the `normal' way to cast, and all spellcasting rules discussed are assumed to apply to memory-casting. 

A spell is considered memorised when it has been cast successfully a number of times from a book in a `real life' scenario (i.e. you have to actually use the spell for its intended purpose, not just cast it wildly into thin air). The number of successful book-casts, $N$, is calculated from:
$$N = 10 - \left( \text{INT modifier + Arcane Proficiency} \right)$$


\subsection{Casting Checks}

A check has two ingedients: the check type, so that you may know which bonuses to apply, and the check-difficulty, so that you may know the target value. 

The check-type is determined by the Discipline that the spell originates from, according to the following prescription:
\def\x{2}
\def\w{2}
\begin{center}
	\begin{rndtable}{c m{\x cm} p{\w cm}}
	\bf School	&	\bf Discipline	&	\bf Attribute
	\\
	\school{Charms}{Elemental}{INT}{Kinesis}{FIN}
	\\
	\school{Divination}{Telepathy}{EMP}{Temporal}{INT}
	\\
	\school{Illusion}{Bewitchment}{CHR}{Psionics}{SPR}
	\\
	\school{Malediction}{Hexes}{SPR}{Curses}{POW}
   \\ 
   \school{Recuperation}{Healing}{EMP}{Warding}{INT}
	\\
	\school{Transfiguration}{Alteration}{FIN}{Conjuration}{POW}
	\\
	\school{Dark Arts}{Necromancy}{EVL}{Occultism}{POW}
	\end{rndtable}
\end{center}

You may, therefore, apply your INT modifier when casting a spell belonging to the Elemental Discipline. You may also ask your GM if it is appropriate to add on a Proficiency modifier to the check, i.e. if you are using a spell from the Bewitchment discipline, the Persuasion or Deception proficiencies may be appropiate, depending on the spell and the specific circumstances. 

The target roll of a check (the DV) is the minimum value of the casting check (CC) which is required in order for the spell effect to be successfully initiated. It is determined by the level and type of the spell, as given by the following table:

\begin{center}
	\begin{rndtable}{c c c c c}
		~	&	Instant	&	Concentration	&	Ward	&	Ritual
		\\
		\cellcolor{\tablecolorhead} Beginner & 	3	&	2	&	4	&	3
		\\
		\cellcolor{\tablecolorhead} Novice	& 	5	&	3	&	6	&	5
		\\
		\cellcolor{\tablecolorhead} Adept	&	6	&	4	&	8	&	8	
		\\
		\cellcolor{\tablecolorhead} Expert	&	8	&	6	&	10	&	10
		\\
		\cellcolor{\tablecolorhead} Master	&	10	&	8	&	12	&	12
		
	\end{rndtable}
\end{center}

\subsection{Fortitude}


Casting spells is not as simple as waving your wands and saying the magic words -- it takes great mental clarity to cast, and you can become exhausted from casting difficult spells. This mental burden is enumerated through the Fortitude Points attribute. 

Each spell has an associated FP cost, which is deducted only after it is successfully cast. If the casting fails, then only half of the fortitude cost is deducted (rounded up).
 
You cannot cast a spell if it would send you into negative FP -- you must wait for your head to clear before attempting that spell.  

The fortitude cost of a given spell is determined by the spell type (Instant, Concentration,Ritual etc.) and the difficulty of the spell, and if the spell is cast from memory or not. A book-cast spell has a 50\% higher FP cost than if the caster is familiar with the spell. 

The table below gives the memory-cast FP cost first, with the book-cast cost in brackets.

\begin{center}
	\begin{rndtable}{c |c c | c c |c c| c c}
		~ & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Instant} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Concentration} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Ward} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Ritual}
		\\
		\cellcolor{\tablecolorhead} Beginner & 	3 &(5) 	& 	2 &(3)	& 	4 &(6) 	& 	 3&(5)
		\\
		\cellcolor{\tablecolorhead} Novice	& 	5 &(8)	&	3 &(4)	&	6&(9)	&	5 &(8)
		\\
		\cellcolor{\tablecolorhead} Adept	&	7 &(11)	&	5& (8)	&	8 &(12)	&	8 &(12)
		\\
		\cellcolor{\tablecolorhead} Expert	&	9 &(14)	&	7 &(11)	&	10 &(15)	&	10 &(15)
		\\
		\cellcolor{\tablecolorhead} Master	&	12 &(18)	&	8& (12)	&	12 &(18)	&	15 &(23)
	\end{rndtable}
\end{center}
\normalsize
Some rare spells are noted as having a different FP cost than this stated value. If so, that value should be used instead. 


\subsection{Power Points}

Some spells have the option to dedicate {\it Power Points} (PP) to their casting when cast from memory. Adding Power Points to a spell amplifies that spells effects, it might make it do more damage, last longer or have a wider area of effect. 

You must declare the number of power points you are dedicating to a spell before performing the check. Each power point dedicated increases the DV of the casting by one, and the FP cost by two. The maximum number of PP that can be dedicated is equal to one third of your POW attribute. 

Some spells specify that, when cast by a character of a certain level, they acquire `free' power points. These power points do not increase the DV or FP cost of the spell, and only apply when calculating the effect. You may still add your own PP to these spells following the normal rules. 


 

\newpage
\section{Spell Shapes}

Some spells produce bolts of energy which fly towards a target, whilst others project their energy into a given region, which are often classified via geometrical shapes: a {\it line}, a {\it cube}, a {\it sphere}, a {\it circle} a {\it cone} or a {\it cylinder}. These shapes may either originate around the caster, or from a point designated by the spell. 

\subsection{Circle}

A circular spell extends outwards from the point of origin in a 2D circular shockwave that lies parallel to the ground. The height of the shockwave above the ground is set by the point of origin, which is not included in the shockwave region (unless the caster chooses it to be). Because of its 2D nature, a circular spell can be avoided by ducking beneath it, or jumping over it -- it is only if the shockwave impacts you that the spell effect is applied. 

\subsection{Cone}

The point of origin of a cone is typically the caster's wand, and a cone extends outwards from the wand, in the direction that the wand is pointing. A cone extends forwards to the specified distance, and has a circular cross section, the radius of which is equal to the distance away from the point of origin (so it is a 45$^\circ$ cone).

 The point of origin of the cone is not considered part of the spell area. 

\subsection{Cube}

The point of origin for a cubic spell may be selected to be either the centre of the cube, or the centre of one of its 6 sides. The cube's side-length is specified by the spell effect. The cube point of origin is only affected by the spell if you choose the centre-origin.

\subsection{Cylinder}

A cylinder point of origin is specified to be a point on the ground, around which a circular cross section is drawn, and then a cylinder of energy rises up vertically to a specified height. Generally, a cylinder spell adjusts its size to an individual, and if not otherwise specified, the cylinder is 5cm wider than the target individual is wide, and 5cm taller than the target. The point of origin is affected by the spell. 

\subsection{Line}

A line extends in a straight path from the origin (a caster's wand) towards the target for a specified distance. Unless otherwise specified, the beam is considered to have the cross section equivalent to a pencil. The point of origin is not affected by the spell. 

\subsection{Sphere}

A sphere's point of origin lies at the centre, and the spell effect expands equally out in all directions from that point. Generally, the spell effect cannot penetrate into the ground or through solid objects (unless, for example, it is an explosion). The point of origin is affected by the spell.
