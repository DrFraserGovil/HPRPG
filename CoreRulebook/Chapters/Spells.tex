\chapter{Spells}

Spells are how Wizards and Witches get by in the world, it is what makes them special. 



\section{Casting Spells}

Spells are broken down into 7 categories: Hexes \& Curses, Transfiguration, Charms, Recuperation, Illusion, Divination, and Dark Arts. Different types of spells require different abilities to cast: illusion spells often require the charisma and deception to overpower the target{\apos}s willpower, whilst hexes and curses often rely on sheer magical power for their effectiveness.

All spells are cast by performing the relevant checks -- rolling a dice, and then adding on the associated skill modifiers and bonuses for that check type -- and then deducting the associated fortitude cost. Each spell has its own check type, which is specified in the spell list below. The dice that you get to use to perform the casting check depends on the level of the skill that you have in the associated school of magic (i.e. the 7 skills associated with each of the 7 schools of magic). 

If you possess enough FP to make the cast, and the casting check is greater than or equal to the difficulty of the spell (also listed in the spell tables), then the spell is successfully cast. 

The dice that you get are enumerated below:

\begin{center}
	\begin{rndtable}{|c c c|}

	\bf Level & \bf  Name & \bf Die
	\\ 
	1 & Beginner & 1d6
	\\
	2 & Novice & 1d8
	\\
	3 & Adept & 1d10 (with 0 = 10)
	\\
	4 & Expert & 1d12
	\\
	5 & Master & 1d20
	\\ \hline
	\end{rndtable}
\end{center}

As you get more and more powerful in each of the 7 schools of magic, you therefore unlock larger and larger dice, which grants you access to more powerful spells, and also makes casting spells of a lower level easier and easier (as there is less chance of failure). 

There are two kinds of spell: an effect-only spell, which either succeeds or does not; and a power-dependent spell, where the outcome of the spell can vary depending on the success of the casting. 

Effect-Only spells are the most basic kind of spell, for example, the Fire-Starting charm (\textit{incendio}), either starts a fire, or it does not, and the Compass Spell (\textit{point me}) either tells you which way North is, or it does not. These spells are therefore in the first class: effect-only. Contrast this with the Torturing Curse (\textit{crucio}). This can not only succeed or fail, but can cause varying amounts of pain. It is therefore a power-dependent spell, as the success of the spell can vary.

Effect-only (E-Class) spells are cast by performing the check type specified in the tables below.

Power-dependent (P-class) spells have the same casting mechanism except you may choose to donate PWR points towards the spell before the check is initialised, up to the total PWR of your character. Each additional PWR point dedicated towards the spell increases the effectiveness of the spell, doing more damage, or adding more side effects. However, powerful spells are more difficult to cast: for each power point you add on, you increase the difficulty value and the fortitude cost of the spell by 1.

Hence, a spell which does 1d8 of damage to target, with a difficulty of 10 and costing 5 Fortitude can be boosted with 5 PWR points to do 1d8 + 5 damage, but the boosted spell has a difficulty of 15, and a Fortitude cost of 10. 
Hence, there is a higher chance of failure, but the rewards for success are much higher! The maximum number of PWR points you can assign a spell is limited by your PWR attribute itself (you can{\apos}t assign more PWR than you have).

The GM may decide that a particular usage of an E-Class spell warrants an extra effort, despite a nominal effect-only status, i.e. setting light to an entire building, rather than starting a campfire would still use incendio, but clearly is a far more powerful use of the firelighting charm! The GM has the authority to override the difficulty and checks required for a spell if the situation calls for it. 

The Fortitude cost for a spell is deducted only after it is successfully cast. If the casting fails, then only half of the fortitude cost is deducted (rounded up), plus whatever negative effects the failed cast might have. 

Oh, one final rule. If your character is saying the incantation, so must you. Bonus points for good acting.



\section{Learning New Spells}

Spells are learned by studying, either from books, or from a teacher.
 
To learn a spell, you must purchase a spell book from a vendor (or find a Professor who already knows the spell), and dedicate an entire day to learning that spell. When that day is up, you get three attempts to cast the spell using the usual casting check. 

If at least one of these casting checks succeeds, you have successfully learned the spell, and you may add it to your arsenal. If all three checks fail, you go have to go back to the start, and begin the learning process again, losing another day in the process. 

Each spellbook contains three spells that you can learn, before you must purchase another, and you are originally limited to learning only 3 spells per level. When you level up, this counter resets, and you may learn another 3 spells.

A professor who already knows the spell you want to learn is an adequate replacement for a spellbook, and may teach an unlimited number of students an unlimited number of spells, but only if they already know the spell. A professor must learn a spell in the usual fashion (unless they can find another professor to teach them!)

\section{Wards}

A ward is (usually) a Recuperation spell that affects a large area. A ward may be centred on a fixed point or object, or may be centred on a moving location or even a sentient being. 

Wards, however, have an unfortunate habit of interfering with each other when used in unison. If two wards have a significant overlapping region of effect and the caster does not have the {\it Multiward} skill or an equivalent feat, there is a significant chance (determined by the GM) that both wards will collapse. 

The interference only applies if the wards are similar in magnitude and intent. For example, Hogwarts castle is a heavily warded region, but a small ward could be placed in a room without problem. Interference would only become a problem when a new castle-wide ward was attempted. 

Equally, intereference only applies if the effects of the ward compound each other -- if they lie in opposition, then the usual spell mechanics are applied. For example, a character with a personal shield ward touches a beartrap ward -- neither ward collapses, but the beartrap ward is triggered, and the shield will attempt to protect the character.

\chapter{Spell List}

This section contains a list of all the spells available in the game. First, the spells are presented broken down into the school and level to which they belong. The next section then contains a full description of the spell, including its casting check, casting difficulty, and spell effects.

Spells marked with a (*) gain more effects, or increase in power, at higher levels.
