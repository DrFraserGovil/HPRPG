\section{Health}\index{Health}\index{Harm}\label{S:Health}

The \key{Health} of a character is an abstracted representation of their physical wellbeing. As you suffer \key{harm} and take \key{damage} (discussed more on page \pageref{S:Damage}), you lose health and begin to suffer negative consequences. 

These consequences increase in severity as you take more and more harm, until eventually you are left in a \imp{Critical Condition}, and either fall unconscious or approach death. 

Most characters start with 8 levels of health, starting at \key{Unharmed}, progressing through \key{Injured} eventually to \key{Critical Condition}. The higher levels of harm are associated with a decrease in your ability to function on both a mental and a physical level. This is enumerated by a dice-penalty to all checks, as enumerated in the table below:

\dotTable{\key{Unharmed}}{\key{Sore}}{\key{Bruised} - take a 1d penalty}{\key{Hurt} - take a 2d penalty}{\key{Injured} - take a 3d penalty}{\key{Wounded} - take a 4d penalty}{\key{Mangled} - take a 5d penalty}{\key{Critical Condition} - you are unconscious, in a coma, or nearing death}{{Health Rating}}

The character sheet provided on page \pageref{S:CharacterSheet} contains seven diamonds to mark off as you take harm. 


\subsection{Increasing or Decreasing Maximum Health}

The character sheet also possesses space for additional health diamonds to be added. This is because magical effects can increase the vitality of a being, allowing it to soak up more damage before becoming impaired. Equally, the physical status of a character might require that they have additional health either from physical conditioning and training (see page \pageref{S:Progression}), or from their innate resilience - a \imp{Half-Giant} can take a lot more of a beating than a normal human, for example. 

When an additional \imp{Health} point is gained, it is added to the {\bf top} of the health-stack. These additional diamonds are therefore marked off first. If the effect granting addtional health is only temporary, when the effect is removed, you simply remove any additional diamonds and leave the rest of the \imp{Health} untouched. 

For example, if an unharmed character (health = \emptyCape) gains an additional health point by drinking a potion, their new health is $\mdwhtdiamond$ + \emptyCape, with the additional dot at the front. 

If the character then takes level three harm, they fill in the first three diamonds, giving a health rating of $\mdblkdiamond$ + \twoCape. When the potion wears off, the additional diamond is removed, leaving the character on a health rating of \twoCape. Drinking the health potion therefore allows the character to reduce their level of harm by one level\footnote{Of course, you might wonder why this is different to just healing by 1 point after the damage was dealt. Note that if a character gained an additional 2 health dots, and then took level 7 \imp{harm}, this would leave them awake and \imp{Wounded} when the effect wore off - however if they had not increased their health, they would have been knocked unconscious by taking the \imp{critical condition} status, at which point simple healing does not help.}.

If a character has their maximum health level reduced - say by a crippling \imp{blood curse} imposed upon them by a Dark Wizard, you remove the dots from the top (excluding \imp{Critical Condition}). A character suffering from a 2-point health drain would jump straight from \imp{Injured} to \imp{Critical Condition}. If this effect is removed, their health dots return, and they may take additional damage as normal.

\section{Fortitude}\index{Fortitude}

The \key{Fortitude} of a character is a measure of their psychological fitness, their ability to push themselves and defy the odds as things go wrong around them. A character with lots of \imp{Fortitude} remaining is viacious, awake and ready to take on the world, whilst when \imp{Fortitude} reserves are running low, characters have run themselves ragged and have very little left to give before they collapse into exhaustion. 

Fortitude can be expended willingly by a character in order to gain one of the following effects:
\begin{enumerate}
	\boldItem{Increase Odds}{Gain one automatic success on a check (equal to a roll of 12). This increases the odds of success in the check and, in most cases, rules out the possibility of rolling a \imp{Catastrophic Failure}. You must expend the \imp{Fortitude} point before the check is made.}
	\boldItem{Negate Catastrophe}{Turn a \imp{Catastrophic Failure} in a normal, more benign, failure. You may use this abiliy after the dice are rolled.}
	\boldItem{Extra Action}{Gain an additional action in a combat, jumping back into the initiative order.}
	\boldItem{Magic Surge}{Cast a magic spell one level higher than your current \imp{affinity} would normall allow. You must expend the \imp{Fortitude} point before the check is made.}
	\boldItem{Enhanced Endurance}{Negate the effects of your current \imp{Harm} for one turn. You must expend the \imp{Fortitude} point before the check is made.}
\end{enumerate}


Every time you expend \imp{Fortitude}, shade in one of the 7 \imp{Fortitude} dots on your character sheet. When all 7 are shaded in, you take an additional level of \imp{Exhaustion} (see page \pageref{S:Statuses}), you may continue to expend \imp{Fortitude} points, but at the expense of increasing the \imp{Exhaustion} by one level each time. Note that levels of \imp{Exhaustion} preclude you from recovering \imp{Fortitude} by taking \imp{long rests}, but not through other means. 

The maximum level of \imp{Fortitude} can be altered following the same rules as those for \imp{Health} discussed above.

\subsection{Losing Fortitude}

Other effects can also decrease your fortitude - the \imp{Torture spell} ({\it crucio}), for example, breaks the mind of an opponent without touching their physical form, thereby reducing their \imp{Fortitude}. 

Equally, if one acquires the \imp{Exhausted} status by failing to look after one's physical and mental health, you suffer penalties to your \imp{Fortitude}. 

\subsection{Regaining Fortitude}\index{Fortitude!Regeneration}

Expending fortitude causes one become tired, irritable and run down -- in order for a character recover their normal state, they must relax, rest or perform an activity which soothes their soul. 

Every character has a number of actions that they can take to increase their fortitude. these actions are known as \imp{Nourishment Actions}.

\begin{itemize}
	\boldItem{Proper Rest}{A proper night's rest of at least 7 hours sleep (i.e. a \imp{Long Rest}) restores 1 points of \imp{Fortitude}}\index{Sleep}
	\boldItem{Hot Meal}{If you have at least one hot meal per day, you also gain 1 point of \imp{Fortitude}}
	\boldItem{Personality Indulgences}{Every personality grants an action or a set of actions which you can indulge in. When the GM rules that you have met the conditions for this action, you may restore 1 \imp{Fortitude Point}. You can do this up to twice per day.}
\end{itemize}

As the game progresses, you may also encounter some narrative points where it is clear that you are undertaking an action for no other reason than to relax and collect your thoughts - perhaps after emerging from the giant's lair, covered in filth, grime and other unspeakable fluids, you go for a swim in a nearby lake to clean the muck off you. Going out of the way to roleplay narratively interesting actions such as this can be rewarded with a fortitude point. 

As you roleplay and inhabit your character, you may discover additional facets of your character's personality - what makes them tick, and how they would react and behave within the world you are exploring. If you so desire, you can work with the GM to expand and refine your \imp{Personality Indulgences} to better reflect the character that you have built up.
