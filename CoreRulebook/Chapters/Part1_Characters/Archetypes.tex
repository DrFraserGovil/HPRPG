Whilst your character is a unique individual, an adventuring soul destined for greatness, most questers find themslves falling into one of many {\it archetypes} -- are they the headstrong hero who needs to learn humilty? The academic who's quest for knowledge has led to unforseen consequences, or the plucky underdog trying to quit their life of crime? 

The archetype (also known as the {\it class}) of your character is a way of formalising these character types. The role of your character is more than simply the job they perform, it is the prism through which they see the world -- it guides their very essence, how they perceieve themselves and others. The Archetype of a character therefore has a drastic impact on the roleplaying aspect of the game.
   
As well as informing what kind of person your character is, the Archetype serves to provide them with some unique skills ({\it Features}) that they acquire as they progress through the archetype. Each time they level up, their archetype abilities increase in power. Your choice of path also provides you with information about the character's starting equipment and any proficiencies they may already have. 

Most (though not all) Archetypes have multiple paths that can be followed, to further differentiate between characters, these are known as `subtypes', or `subclasses'. The Archetype descriptions provide you with instructions on the available choices and when you must make such a choice. 

The commonly used Archetypes are as follows:
