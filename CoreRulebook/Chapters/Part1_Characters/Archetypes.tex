Whilst your character is a unique individual, an adventuring soul destined for greatness, most questers find themslves falling into one of many {\it archetypes} -- are they the academic who's quest for knowledge has led to unforseen consequences, or the plucky underdog trying to quit their life of crime? 

The archetype (also known as the {\it class}) of your character is a way of formalising these character types. The role of your character is more than simply the job they perform, it is the prism through which they see the world -- along with their personality, it guides their very essence, how they perceieve themselves and others. The Archetype of a character therefore has a drastic impact on the roleplaying aspect of the game.
   
As well as helping to inform what kind of person your character is, the Archetype serves to provide them with some unique skills ({\it Features}) that they acquire and improve as they grow in power, as well as some unique special actions. 

Each archetype is elaborated on in more detail on their own pages. A summary is found below:
