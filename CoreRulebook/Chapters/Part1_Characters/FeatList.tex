Such creatures are also much less likely to attack you on sight\comma{} but will retaliate if provoked.}{0}{}
	\feat{Asteria’s Eyes}{At the beginning of every dawn\comma{} you perform a small ritual underneath the fading stars to divine the future. Over the next day\comma{} you use this knowledge to gain a +1d bonus\comma{} or impose a 1d penalty\comma{} on any roll performed by a creature you can see. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your highest \imp{Affinity} rating in the \imp{Divination} school}{0}{}

	\feat{Cloak of Seasons}{You are magically protected from the effects of the weather and the natural environment.

	\feat{Exuding Aura}{You may expend a \imp{Fortitude} point to attune yourself to your favoured aspect of nature\comma{} exuding an aura which influences the minds of others – perhaps a sweet pine smell calms them\comma{} or animal pheremones send them into a frenzy. You gain +2d on all \imp{Social} checks made against people within 2m of you for the next hour.}{0}{}
	\feat{Freedom of the Wild}{You are able to move freely within natural environments – your climb speed and swim speed are equal to your normal movement speed\comma{} and you are not slowed down by difficult terrain. If a creature attempts to use natural features to gain \imp{Cover}\comma{} you consider it as one level less than normal.}{0}{}
	\feat{Fungal Spore}{You know the secrets of a magical fungal spore\comma{} and can call it forth when you need it. As an action\comma{} you may summon these spore to either inflict the \imp{Poison} status effect (1 damage\comma{} requires 10 successes) on a target you can see in range\comma{} or to perform a DV 8 \imp{Insight (Commune)} check\comma{} healing the target equal to the number of successes. You may do this a number of times per day equal to your \imp{Commune} rating.}{0}{}

By expending a \imp{Fortitude} point\comma{} you may extend this to all \imp{Catastrophes} rolled.}{0}{}
	\feat{Burn Book}{When using your skills to spread rumours\comma{} misinformation or gossip\comma{} or when trying to discredit an individual\comma{} gain +3 dice}{0}{}
	\feat{Distracting Shout}{Your forceful presence extends onto the battlefield – whilst in combat you can use a \imp{minor action} to select a target which has not yet declared their action within 10m and perform some action to get their attention.

	\feat{Takes One to Know One}{You are able to automatically spot people with a similar skillset to your own\comma{} and are aware when someone attempts to \imp{Bamboozle} or otherwise manipulate you or your allies in a social situation.

	\feat{Discerning Eyes}{At the end of every \imp{Long Rest}\comma{} roll a DV 7 check using only your \imp{Analyse} pool (min 1 success). You may expend one of these successes as an instantaneous action to learn about a target as if you had cast the \imp{Identify} spell at \levelThree{} level (though this does not count as a \imp{spellcasting} effort\comma{} and cannot be percieved by others).

	\feat{Hidden Work}{When you complete an \imp{Imbuing} or \imp{Crafting} project\comma{} you

	\feat{Thick Skin}{Years of accidents and lab mishaps have left you with a superhuman level of resilience: choose from \imp{Fire} and \imp{Crushing} or \imp{Acid} and \imp{Poison} damage: any rolls to \imp{Resist} damage of the chosen types has a DV that is 2 lower than normal.}{0}{}

	\feat{Open Mind}{The way that things have always been done is not always the only (or even the best) way. A number of times per day equal to your \imp{Wisdom} rating\comma{} you may use a completely different skill\comma{} tool or ingredient for a given task.

	\feat{Out of Body Experience}{Whilst unconscious or asleep\comma{} your spirit remains awake and aware of your surroundings even as you gain the benefits of rest.

	\feat{Stillness of Mind and Body}{You may expend a \imp{Fortitude} point as an instantaneous action to enter a meditative state\comma{} ending all ongoing status effects on your body: \imp{Poisons} are purged\comma{} \imp{Fear} is banished\comma{} and \imp{Paralysis} wears off. This does not effect status effects imposed by physical phenomena (i.e. you cannot untie ropes giving the \imp{Trapped} status)\comma{} and you must be conscious to use this ability. You can do this a number of times per day equal to your \imp{Self} rating.}{0}{}
	\feat{Wise Teacher}{You are always on the lookout to help others. As a minor action\comma{} you take a second to talk to and inspire your ally: donating your \imp{Widsom} pool to another character within 2m.

	\feat{Chivalrous Defence}{At any point prior to or during your action in the turn cycle\comma{} you may donate up to two dice to a creature within 2m of you that you can see.

	\feat{Duelist}{When fighting against a single foe\comma{} you gain one auto\minus{}success on all attack rolls and Resist actions.}{0}{}
	\feat{Furious Spellcaster}{Up to three times a day\comma{} you may elect to use a \imp{Rage} check\comma{} rather than the associated \imp{Affinity} to perform a spellcasting check. The maximum spell level is still determined by your \imp{Affinity}.}{0}{}

	\feat{Fancy Footwork}{When fighting more than one foe\comma{} you may use an action to expend a \imp{Fortitude} point to confuse your foes with some feat of athletics and maneouvering\comma{} causing them to attack each other.

	\feat{Animagus}{As an exceptionally powerful Thaumaturge\comma{} you have learned to shift your shape into that of an animal. By expending a \imp{Fortitude} point\comma{} you may instantly assume the physical attributes of your `spirit animal’. This animal is (usually) the same as your \imp{Patronus} and can only be changed if your undergo a profound change on a spiritual level. Whilst in this form\comma{} you retain your mental state\comma{} but all your physical statistics and abilities are replaced by those of the form you take. 

You may choose to revert back to your human form at any time\comma{} and you do so automatically if you are reduced to a \imp{Critical Condition} whilst in bestial form.}{1}{\imp{Alteration} (\fiveCape{})}

	\feat{Innate Trick}{As a witch or wizard\comma{} the chaotic force of magic flows within your veins. You have learned to harness this magic in some innate way beyond the usual spellcasting. This effect is usually minor (something a Muggle could put down to an act of trickery or showmanship)\comma{} and often forms the basis of a parlour trick. 

You might be able to summon a small flame from your finger\comma{} make your eyes into burning coals or deep black voids\comma{} play a stirring soundtrack whenever they engage in a fight\comma{} know the name of every individual you meet\comma{} or some other marvellous but ultimately slightly inconsequential feat that you could imagine being the focus of conversation at a party.

	\feat{Light Sleeper}{You need much less sleep than others\comma{} and can go from asleep to awake in a blink of an eye.

	\feat{Loyal Companion}{You have an animal ally which is eternally loyal and devoted to you\comma{} and can carry out simple tasks: a `familiar’. This familiar is a well trained pet and will follow simple orders\comma{} though they cannot communicate back.

	\feat{Psychic Awareness}{Your mind is especially attuned to those of others\comma{} and you can naturally sense the shift induced when a psychic power alters or interacts with minds. Whenever a psychic effect such as mind reading\comma{} memory modification\comma{} or magic which alters emotions and allegiances is used on a target within 5m of you\comma{} you are instantly aware of this – you may expend a \imp{fortitude} point to learn the target of the spell\comma{} as well as the caster and the intent of the spell.}{1}{\imp{Kindness} (\threeCape{})}
	\feat{Ritualist}{You are a strong believer that the most powerful magic is performed with large groups\comma{} in elaborate rituals\comma{} with chanting\comma{} incense and possibly a pentagram or two.

	\feat{Silent Casting}{You do not need to perform the verbal component of a spellcasting action. Efforts to silence you do not impact your spellcasting efforts\comma{} and the lack of an alerting incantation means efforts to \imp{Resist} your spells take a 1d penalty.}{0}{}
