\chapter{Playable Species} \label{C:Species}
 
 Different magical races have different characteristics, abilities, and affinities with different kinds of magic. Each choice of race/species modifies your attribute values by a set amount and provides a pool of extra points which you can allocate to attributes at will, and some race-specific Abilities and Skills. 
 
It is generally impossible to switch species once a character has been created, except where it makes sense within the story (i.e. a human transitioning to a Vampire after being bitten).
