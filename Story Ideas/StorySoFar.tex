\section{Session One: The Introduction}

Session Date: 2/10/19

In our first outing, our four characters arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft \& Wizardry, we sorted into their houses, and found themselves in a group together, whereupon they made introductions. We therefore met:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Helena (Ravenclaw, the shy nerd), played by Laura
	\item Nikc (Gryffindor, the prankster), played by Adam
	\item Cerise (Hufflepuff, the secretive one), played by Chloe
	\item Luke (Hufflepuff, the hulking moron), played by Liam
\end{itemize}
After a quick DADA lesson, in which Liam (unsuccessfully) attempted to hulk-smash a small goblinoid, our protagonists were summoned to a special meeting. 

In the meeting, they were informed of a new educational challenge the school are trialling: the Hogwarts Hunt. The first to track down a pair of magical gloves gets to keep them! With the teachers standing in front of a birdcage perched on a large rock formation, they were informed that the gloves would be released on Thursday morning, and that upon being released, there would be 6 tasks around the castle, which would give them clues as to the location of the gloves.

Between then and now, they have the entire castle's resources to use to prepare themselves for this challenge. 

Our heroes decided to spend their first afternoon learning some new spells, and then headed back to the DADA classroom, and discovered that the birdcage contained a Diricawl (a teleporting dodo), and decided to head down to Hagrid's hut, to learn about the diricawl and other magical creatures. Unfortunately, Hagrid didn't have much to say about the diricawl -- he had not been involved in acquiring it -- unlike the other creatures acquired for the task. 

Cerise managed to sneak a peek at some maps on Hagrid's walls, which seemed to depict a number of locations across Eastern Europe and beyond. 

Having spent several hours trying to get more information, the group eventually decided to head back to bed, to prepare for the next morning.
