\section{Session One: The Introduction}

Session Date: 2/10/19

In our first outing, our four characters arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft \& Wizardry, were sorted into their houses, and found themselves in a group together, whereupon they made introductions. We therefore met:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Helena (Ravenclaw, the shy nerd), played by Laura
	\item Nikc (Gryffindor, the prankster), played by Adam
	\item Cerise (Slytherin, the secretive one), played by Chloe
	\item Luke (Hufflepuff, the hulking moron), played by Liam
\end{itemize}
After a quick DADA lesson, in which Liam (unsuccessfully) attempted to hulk-smash a small goblinoid, our protagonists were summoned to a special meeting. 

In the meeting, they were informed of a new educational challenge the school are trialling: the Hogwarts Hunt. The first to track down a pair of magical gloves gets to keep them! With the teachers standing in front of a birdcage perched on a large rock formation, they were informed that the gloves would be released on Thursday morning, and that upon being released, there would be 6 tasks around the castle, which would give them clues as to the location of the gloves.

Between then and now, they have the entire castle's resources to use to prepare themselves for this challenge. 

Our heroes decided to spend their first afternoon learning some new spells, and then headed back to the DADA classroom, and discovered that the birdcage contained a Diricawl (a teleporting dodo), and decided to head down to Hagrid's hut, to learn about the diricawl and other magical creatures. Unfortunately, Hagrid didn't have much to say about the diricawl -- he had not been involved in acquiring it -- unlike the other creatures acquired for the task. 

Cerise managed to sneak a peek at some maps on Hagrid's walls, which seemed to depict a number of locations across Eastern Europe and beyond. 

Having spent several hours trying to get more information, the group eventually decided to head back to bed, to prepare for the next morning. 

\section{Session Two: The Hunt Begins}

Session Date: 21/10/19

Waking bright and early, our 4 students got to work learning mre useful knowledge -- including checking every copy of Care of Magical creatures books out of the library. They also decided to lock everyone else out of a session in the divination classroom, using the age old tactic of `putting up a sign'. 

Later, whilst scouting the potions classroom for useful information and ingredients, they discovered that some Jobberknoll feathers were missing (but a pair of glasses were in their place). Nikc also took this opportunity to swap a bunch of labels around on the meticulously catelogued ingredients, before the group snuck into the old Potions Master's office, and discovered it to be abandoned.

Whilst hiding in the new `clubhouse', they heard someone dragging a figure down the potions classroom. After a detour into the Slytherin common room (wherin Cerise stared down some burly 4th year students), they discovered a hidden alcove with a statue bearing a secretive, half-written message. 

After this, they decided to learn some potions. Of course, due to Nikc's earlier shenanigans, things didn't quite go to plan for the other students present. Attempts to brew a simple antidote to common poisons resulted in a potent poison being created, and those unfortunate enough to test their creations (approximately 20 students) found themselves in the hospital wing for the next few days, in rather exquisite agony. 

Having cut the level of competition quite significantly, the group went to bed ready for the tasks to start the next day. 

\newpage
{\bf Challenge One}

An executive decision was made by Luke that they should start at the top of the castle, and work their way down. The first task they encounted was therefore the Divination challenge, located in the highest point of the castle. 

In the fusty classroom stood three hooded figures, each claiming another of the figures `spoke only the truth'. After trying to wrap their brains around the riddle, Helena realised 
that she could simply use her {\it Identify} spell to work out who was telling the truth. They therefore gained their first clue:

\begin{center}
{SOLVEI IS IN THE FOREST}
\end{center}

{\bf Challenge Two}

Working their way down the castle, the next challenge was on the 4th floor -- the Recuperation Magic Task. 

Upon entering the classroom, they discovered a crumpled figure being assaulted by a circle of magical stones. Luke threw himself headlong into the centre of the circle, and miraculously did not get hexed to pieces. Working together, the group managed to heal the figure back to full health, earning themselves their second clue:

\begin{center}
{HAGRID IS IN CHARGE OF $X$s   }
\end{center}
