Not a flashy broomstick\comma{} but enough to get you around.}{\galleon{40}}
\inventLine{Comet 530~($\times$10)}{The Comet has never been a flashy brand. This is their latest low\minus{}cost broomstick. It handles like a cow\comma{} but for the price\comma{} it really is quite good.}{\galleon{50}}
\inventLine{Thunderbolt~($\times$2)}{A newcomer to the scene \minus{} the Thunderbolt has cast off much of what we know about broomsticks\comma{} and reinvented many basic principles.

Homely and kind\comma{} she takes joy in feeding people\comma{} and will often slip an extra slice onto the plates of those she thinks are a bit malnourished.} }{Food \& Drink}{A quaint little teashop\comma{} with a purple exterior. A large window opens onto the kitchen\minus{}area\comma{} showing a set of enchanted kitchen tools preparing fresh cakes.}{Inside is an explosion of colour: paisly tablecloths and tartan teapots\comma{} with polka dot chairs.

She has a nervous stutter\comma{} and seem unsure of herself – until she starts talking about alchemy and potions.} }{Potions}{The outside of the shop is almost entiely obscured by a thick rolling fog that seems to be coming from a top floor window. Every few minutes\comma{} there’s a loud {\it crack} sound\comma{} and the colour of the smoke changes – usually accompanied by some choice curses.}{Inside the air is clean and fresh\comma{} and smells of fresh picked grass and other herbs. 

Rows upon rows of jars line the walls\comma{} all meticulously labelled.

Matted blond hair falls to his mid back\comma{} and his outfit is an insane medley of colours and styles. His fingers have an assortment of rings and other decorations (most of which are hideous and obviously made of actual rubbish). 

He is very possessive of the stuff in his shop\comma{} and gets very defensive when it is insulted as useless.} }{Various}{The exterior of this shop is almost non\minus{}existent – it is simply a door wedged inside a great mound of crates stacked outside the font of the shop\comma{} obscuring everything else about the bulding and spilling out onto the street.}{A dark\comma{} fusty and cramped interior\comma{} the room is filled with rows upon rows of shelves covered in what is almost entirely rubbish. 

The stuff does not smell\comma{} but it comprises of broken pottery and dented metal plates\comma{}  Threadbare blankets and two\minus{}legged chairs.}{Most of the stuff in this shop is pure junk. Though on a successful DV12 Investigation check\comma{} a number of worthwhile items can be found. 

~A full inventory for this shop can be found at the end  of the document}

\shop{The Newt\apos{}s Eye}{Diagon Alley}{\basicPerson{Jean\minus{}Luc Appelard}{The most stereotypical frenchman you will ever meet. He speaks with a flourish\comma{} and carries a baguette under one arm. He looks with disdain on the silly englishmen\comma{} though he is more than happy to take their money. 

The rumour is that his true name is Frank Butterworth\comma{} and that he accidentally consumed a herb which caused him to act this way.} }{Alchemical Supplies}{This store is abviously well\minus{}looked after\comma{} and is meticulously clean. 

A number of racks of herbs and other alchemical supplies stand out the front to dry and for display purposes.}{Inside the same meticulous air is apparent\comma{} with every alchemical supply neatly stored inside a perfectly clean jar. The jars themselves are all perfectly aligned and have labels written in exactly the same neat hand.}{A full inventory for this shop can be found at the end  of the document}

\shop{Weasley\apos{}s Wizard Wheezes}{Diagon Alley}{\basicPerson{George Weasley}{A one\minus{}eared\comma{} red\minus{}haired jokester\comma{} who spends most of his time playing pranks on his customers\comma{} rather than trying to sell them anything. 

Unusually\comma{} however\comma{} this business model has turned out to be an incredible success\comma{} and George and his brother Ron have turned this into a successful business.} }{Prank shop}{A prominent shop\comma{} right on the street corner\comma{} made even more noticeable by the large weasley\minus{}esque statue mounted atop the frontage.

\shop{Borgin \& Burke\apos{}s}{Nockturn Alley}{\basicPerson{Mr Borgin}{An oily\comma{} creepy gentleman\comma{} Mr Borgin is wholly unpleasant. He is obsessed with money\comma{} and seems not to care if he earns it by selling dangerous and evil artefacts. 

He will buy and sell anything: stolen\comma{} cursed or downright posessed by demonic forces; as long as there is profit involved.} }{Dark Magic}{The front of the shop is painted in green paint\comma{} which is in need of dire repair as it cracks and falls off.

Items lies on gilded pillow cases and in tall display cases\comma{} meticulously labelled in spindly handwriting.}{A full inventory for this shop can be found at the end  of the document}

\shop{Cobb and Webb\apos{}s}{Nockturn Alley}{\basicPerson{Spinstress Simone Belvoire}{Just by looking at this elderly lady\comma{} you can tell she has an unhealthy obsession with arachnids.

}

\shop{Hagg\apos{}s Feast}{Nockturn Alley}{\basicPerson{Rinna the Mad}{You can\apos{}t quite decide if Rinna is an elderly and slightly insane which\comma{} or an actual Hag. 

Certainly\comma{} her mannerisms\comma{} pointed teeth and warted face point to the latter\comma{} and she has an unsettling habit of cackling maniacally.} }{Meat}{The shop window has been totally blacked out\comma{} as if the proprietor doesn't like sunlight.}{Inside there are display units showing all kinds of exotic meats. You\apos{}re somewhat afraid to ask what some of the meat is\comma{} especially the stuff that still seems to be moving.}{If you can kill it and eat it\comma{} you can buy it here. Prices start at \sickle{10}\comma{} and go up from there.}

\shop{Mulpepper\apos{}s Apothecary}{Nockturn Alley}{\basicPerson{Mary Mulpepper III}{A sweet and charming lady in her 30s. She has dark brown hair and cheerful eyes. 

Despite her outwardly beautiful appearance\comma{} it is disturbing to hear her talk so openly and candildly about the viciousness of some of the alchemical ingredients she harbours and the potential uses for them.} }{Dangerous Alchemical Ingredients}{The window is blotted out by stacks and stacks of grubby jars\comma{} filled with a green fluid\comma{} in which float shadows which suggest horrifying contents.}{Inside there are yet more jars\comma{} with their floating contents slowly picklilng away. 

There are also some dry goods to be found in the centre of the shop.}{A full inventory for this shop can be found at the end  of the document}

\shop{Shyverwretch\apos{}s Venoms and Poisons}{Nockturn Alley}{\basicPerson{Wendy}{Wendy is a (former) House\minus{}Elf\comma{} and now a member of the Free Elf establishment. 

Her former master was the owner of this establishment\comma{} until he met a sticky end\comma{} and if the rumours are to be believed\comma{} his servant had something to do with it.  

Wendy seems like a cheerful house elf\comma{} but occasionally the mask slips and reveals a deep sociopathic streak beneath the surface.} }{Poisons}{Delicate glass vials are stacked neatly in the window. They would be beautiiful\comma{} were it not for the ugly colouration of some of them.}{Inside there are more glass jars\comma{} and more suspect liquids. 

Your nose burns with the acrid atmosphere\comma{} though Wendy doesn\apos{}t seem to notice.}{A full inventory for this shop can be found at the end  of the document}

\shop{The Coffin House}{Nockturn Alley}{\basicPerson{N/A}{N/A} }{Dangerous Black Magic}{The smashed in front door and the official\minus{}looking Auror tape outside indicate that this shop was recently raided and shut down by the ministry\comma{} presumably for conducting some heinous black\minus{}magic crime.}{The inside is charred and still lightly smoking. It looks like a large magical battle was fought here\comma{} and a slight metallic smell in the air hint at a large amount of bloodshed.}{N/A}

\shop{White Wyvern}{Nockturn Alley}{\basicPerson{Gnarlock}{A young but visibly battle\minus{}scarred goblin. Gnarlock has no time for humans unless they\apos{}re putting coin into his pocket. 

Dismissive and gruff\comma{} he is unpleasant to everyone and anyone\comma{} but {\it especially} newcomers.} }{Pub \& Inn}{A dilapidated old pub\comma{} with a rusted sign depicting a dragon. From the name\comma{} you presume it used to be white\comma{} but the sign is more of a grubby grey nowadays.}{Inside is dark and dank. Hooded patrons sit at the bar muttering to one another. 

When newcomers arrive\comma{} they all turn to look at them with suspicion in their eyes.}{Fire whiskey (\knut{10})}

\shop{Daily Prophet HQ}{Venter Alley}{\basicPerson{Barnabus Cuffe}{The editor\minus{}in\minus{}chief of the Daily Prophet for several decades\comma{} Barnabus Cuffe is an affable gentleman – always seen wearing an impeccable suit and tie underneath a formal wizarding gown. 

His affable demeanor is\comma{} however\comma{} mostly for show and beneath the surface he is a man consumed with the need to accumulate and gather power and influence. He will let nothing (let alone the truth) get in the way of his media empire.} }{Newspaper Printers}{An unassuming building\comma{} without a formal shopfront. 

The only indicators that this is anything other than a residential house is a formal plaque next to the door\comma{} and a dispenser for the Daily Prophet on the street outside.}{The interior is significantly larger than the exterior\comma{} and houses a full magical printing press\comma{} as well as several offices for the prominent journalists. 

The office of the editor is on the second level\comma{} but with a large window capable of overseeing the entire operation.}{Daily Prophet (\knut{8})}

\shop{Flibberdigibits \& Watchemacallems}{Venter Alley}{\basicPerson{Store Clerk}{A fairly faceless employee of this chain of grocery stores. He has a slightly vacant expression as he processes your order\comma{} but he seems nice.} }{Groceries}{This shop looks almost identical to all the others in the chain \minus{} a bright blue storefront\comma{} with signs and placards indicating the current deals.}{Inside there are rows and rows of fresh produce from around the world\comma{} including some muggle goods that have caught on lately.}{Roughly \sickle{3} for enough food to feed one person for one day.}

\shop{Ministry of Magic}{Venter Alley}{\basicPerson{Galen Rex}{The new Minister for Magic\comma{} who rode into power on a populist wave\comma{} after widespread unease at the liberalising reforms made by the previous minister. 

Galen is a former Healer by trade\comma{} turned to politics. He is charming and suave\comma{} though his political views and methods have caused many to question his ethics\comma{} he is incredibly popular.} }{Government}{The Ministry is mostly operated underground (underneath what the muggles refer to as Leicester Square)\comma{} however there is a majestic open\minus{}air entrance at the end of Venter Alley.

A wide open plaza full of statues of famous witches and wizards throughout the ages can be found. The square is normally full of bustling tourists and ministry workers alike.}{The atrium of the ministry is covered with midnight\minus{}blue tiles in a forum that (even though from outside it seemed only two or three stories tall) stretches up into immense heights. Enchanted messages flit from side to side\comma{} and there is a continual foot traffic as employees rush through this nexus.}{N/A}

\shop{Simon\apos{}s Simple Shields}{Venter Alley}{\basicPerson{Simple Simon}{Don\apos{}t let his name fool you \minus{} this blonde\minus{}haired blued eyes supermodel is incredibly intelligent. 

He prefers to cultivate an air which lets others underestimate him\comma{} and so he often mans his store topless and with a gormless stare. When it comes down actual business\comma{} however\comma{} you find him a ruthless negotiator.} }{Defensive Armour}{Above the door\comma{} two strong iron shields are set. 

If you enter with ill\minus{}intent\comma{} the shields ignite with a fiery glow\comma{} and a forcefield expels you out of the front door.}{Inside is incredibly hot\comma{} as Simon attends to the forge which he magically shields to keep the worst of the heat out. 

Shields and armour both magical and mundane are lying around in a clutter. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to the placement of the objects in this shop.}{A full inventory for this shop can be found at the end  of the document}

\shop{Warcasters}{Venter Alley}{\basicPerson{Longtail}{An incredibly unusual sight outside of their forested domains: Longtail is a centaur. 

Even more unusually\comma{} he is not involved in the usual divination magic. Longtail was a Sentinel for his clan\comma{} before being kicked out for his extremist views regarding the merpeople. 

Now he uses his martial prowess to make a profit by smithing and creating weapons\comma{} both magical and mundane.} }{Offensive Weapons}{In the shop window is a single stand\comma{} holding a magnificent glowing greatsword. 

Through the sword itself seems perfectly ordinary\comma{} there is a magical aura that causes passers by to stop and gape at it.}{Inside more weapons can be found\comma{} strapped meticulously in order\comma{} arranged by type\comma{} price and enchantment level. 

The air is heavy with the scent of weapon oil and magic.}{A full inventory for this shop can be found at the end  of the document}
