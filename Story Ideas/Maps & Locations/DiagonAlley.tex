His affable demeanor is\comma{} however\comma{} mostly for show and beneath the surface he is a man consumed with the need to accumulate and gather power and influence. He will let nothing (let alone the truth) get in the way of his media empire.} }{Newspaper Printers}{An unassuming building\comma{} without a formal shopfront. 

The only indicators that this is anything other than a residential house is a formal plaque next to the door\comma{} and a dispenser for the Daily Prophet on the street outside.}{The interior is significantly larger than the exterior\comma{} and houses a full magical printing press\comma{} as well as several offices for the prominent journalists. 

The office of the editor is on the second level\comma{} but with a large window capable of overseeing the entire operation.}{Daily Prophet (\knut{8})}

He will refuse to sell an owl if he believes it will be maltreated.} }{Owls}{A huge number of vertical poles stand outside this shop. During daytime\comma{} a multitude of different colour owls occupy them\comma{} cooing and hooting to one another.}{Inside\comma{} the ceiling reaches all the way to the rafters\comma{} creating a very tall (if narrow) space for the owls to fly.

A Wonka\minus{}esque pioneer of flavours\comma{} he seems much younger than his advanced years.} }{Ice cream parlour}{A handful of chairs and small tables\comma{} with sunshades\comma{} all a light duck\minus{}egg blue sit outside the storefront\comma{} which (on sunny days) is fully opened to expose the interior to the outside world.}{More chairs and tables are inside the brightly lit interior\comma{} along with a front desk harbouring thousand of flavours of icecream – a multicoloured medly of flavour and sweetness.}{Icecream costs \knut{5} a scoop. 

If you can imagine a flavour\comma{} they have it\comma{} no matter how odd.}

He is very possessive of the stuff in his shop\comma{} and gets very defensive when it is insulted as useless.} }{Various}{The exterior of this shop is almost non\minus{}existent – it is simply a door wedged inside a great mound of crates stacked outside the font of the shop\comma{} obscuring everything else about the bulding and spilling out onto the street.}{A dark\comma{} fusty and cramped interior\comma{} the room is filled with rows upon rows of shelves covered in what is almost entirely rubbish.
