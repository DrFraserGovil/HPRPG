\inventory{
	name = Hogwarts Robes, 
	amount = 1, 
	class = Clothing, 
	hasAcquired = 1, 
	acquired = Purchased prior to arriving at Hogwarts, 
	description = A simple set of black wizards robes with a colourful lining reflecting the Hogwarts House that you belong to. These robes are generally regarded as old fashioned and a bit odd to wear outside of school environs\comma{} but not totally unusual. 

These robes give you a +1 to all casting checks whilst you are wearing them.,

	amount = 1, 
	class = Clothing, 
	hasAcquired = 1, 
	acquired = Purchased from Weasley\apos{}s Wizarding Wheezes, 
	description = First developed by the Weasley twins as a prank item prior to the Second Wizarding War\comma{} the Ministry took a great interest in the Shield Hat as a defensive item. As a result\comma{} an entirely new line of (mostly) serious products were introduced. 

Outwardly\comma{} the shield hat appears to be a normal pointed wizard\apos{}s hat\comma{} though a peek inside the brim reveals some glowing enchanted runes. Once per day\comma{} the wearer can mentally trigger a the hat to produce a shield which projects outwards for a few moments\comma{} before quickly fading. 

This shield is equivalent to the {\it Force Field} spell cast at a third level. During the turn cycle in which the field is activated\comma{} you have an impenetrable field which stops all spells and physical attacks from passing through it. 

This shield has a health of 40HP. If any attack would cause the shield to drop to 0HP\comma{} the shield is dispelled and half the remaining damage is dealt to the wearer.,

	acquired = Given by Galen Rex, 
	description = An enchanted portkey given to you by the ministry. The outward appearance is of a {\it Moo box}\comma{} a muggle toy in the shape of a cylinder which produces a loud mooing sound when tipped. This one\comma{} however\comma{} appears to have been warped and broken\comma{} because the noise it makes bears very little resemblence to a real cow. 

Upon tipping it up twice in rapid successiong\comma{} the portkey takes you to Hogsmeade. 

This object is single\minus{}use.,

	description = A small pouch containing an almost impossibly black\comma{} gritty powder. 

When tossed into the air\comma{} the powder expands an fills a sphere up to 3 metres in radius. The powder is so pervasively black that it prevents all light from passing through it. All sight lines which pass through the afflicted area automatically fail.,
