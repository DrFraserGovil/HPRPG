	%%CharBegin\character{Cerise Lucrezia Umbridge\minus{}Malfoy}{Pureblood Human}{Slytherin (3)}{5'2" tall\comma{} 16 years old\comma{} pale skin and plantinum blonde hair. Likes to wear pink.}{During a moment of weakness and stress when his wife\comma{} Astoria\comma{} was dying from a blood curse\comma{} Draco Malfoy seduced and took solace in the arms of a much younger Marion Umbridge. 

Upon waking the next morning\comma{} Draco was so disgusted with himself that he removed all trace of the memory of what happened from the still sleeping Marion\comma{} before dressing\comma{} going home\comma{} and begging his mother to do the same to him as he could not cope with the guilt.

However\comma{} a couple of months later\comma{} it became apparent that Marion was pregnant. An investigation into her pregnancy and memory loss fingered the Malfoy bloodline\comma{} but before Draco was found to be the father\comma{} Lucius stepped forward and claimed the unborn child as his own (at his \apos{}Äôs urging). This spared Draco further despair as he was also now grieving the death of his wife\comma{} along with caring for their son\comma{} Scorpius. A lot of money and favours were traded to keep the pregnancy quiet and for the investigation to cease.

Lucius swore to secrecy a couple of close pureblood acquaintances\comma{} telling them how he\apos{}Äôd seduced the tipsy young Marion (he\apos{}Äôd had her memory \apos{}Äúreturned\apos{}Äù to her\comma{} placing his face over Draco\apos{}Äôs)\comma{} so therefore it was an open secret in pureblood society. Narcissa played her part as a besmirched wife well\comma{} when in truth she was excited about the possibility of another grandchild. Cerise\apos{}Äôs birth also aided Draco out of his grief\comma{} a cute little bundle of cooing blonde to help to remind him that life continues and could be beautiful.

Cerise spent her summers at Malfoy Manor with her \apos{}Äúfather\apos{}Äù Lucius doting on her\comma{} and Narcissa spoiling her with broomsticks and flying lessons. They do their best to instil into her the family dogma of that purebloods are better than anyone else. Cerise loves spending time with them\comma{} and is so happy that she takes after her \apos{}Äúbrother\apos{}Äù Draco so much.

The rest of the year\comma{} Cerise spends with her mother\comma{} Marion. They live in a beautiful cottage in the countryside\comma{} away from muggles and magic users alike. Marion knows that there is something wrong with her memories\comma{} that something very bad happened to her\comma{} and this has caused her to be distrustful of the world.

The county cottage\comma{} that Lucius provided\comma{} is her haven and sanctuary. Despite her parent\apos{}Äôs\comma{} Arthur and Sybil\comma{} urging\comma{} Marion never pursued any relationships after Cerise was born. She was a devoted mother and herbalist\comma{} preferring to live in solitude with her daughter and study the world around her (Ravenclaw). She knows the tarnish that comes with the Umbridge name\comma{} and avoids contact with the magical world as much as possible\comma{} with many unaware that she even has a daughter.

Their home is full of colour and light. They bake every day as it is one of Cerise\apos{}Äôs favourite hobbies\comma{} and care for any creature that wanders past in need of help. Cerise likes to practice her magics on them\comma{} calming and soothing them so she can heal them and set them free again. Sometimes she even likes to experience the world through them\comma{} seeing and hearing what the animals do on their wanderings. Other times\comma{} she entertains her mother with illusions\comma{} recreating stories from books or tales of old.

Marion\apos{}Äôs parents disapprove of Cerise\apos{}Äôs very existence. As far as they are concerned\comma{} Marion brought shame upon the family (more so than Arthur\apos{}Äôs sister Delores did) and believe that Cerise should have been deposited on the Malfoy\apos{}Äôs doorstep when she was born. There is no love for their granddaughter and they have frequently pushed Marion to marry and have \apos{}Äúproper\apos{}Äù children. Despite Marion wanting to home school her daughter\comma{} both her parents and the Malfoy\apos{}Äôs have insisted that Cerise attend Hogwarts\comma{} with her parents planning on making it as difficult as possible for Cerise to return home for the holidays.

While Cerise is away\comma{} the Umbridge\apos{}Äôs are scheming to set up Marion with any interested and eligible bachelor in Europe. They hope that once she meets the right man\comma{} she\apos{}Äôll forget all about Cerise and become a proper young woman again.

Cerise is terrified of being at Hogwarts. She has never really had friends before\comma{} and has no idea how to relate to people. She is filled with the belief\comma{} as a pureblood of the Malfoy family\comma{} that she is better than anyone else. This is countered with her mother\apos{}Äôs wariness and distrust of people\comma{} and knowledge of how hated the Umbridge name is. 

She acts snooty when she is desperate to make friends. She bakes for people\comma{} but no one eats what she makes as they sneer that a Slytherin either wants something in return or has poisoned them. She wants to be powerful and successful\comma{} so her grandparents accept her and her mother would be proud. She wants to earn and fulfil her potential as a pureblood and not disappoint her father. She is filled with desperate ambition\comma{} but wanted to be in House Hufflepuff. 

She lies and deceives to protect herself from the cruel world her mother warned her of. If anyone dares to question her\comma{} she becomes prickly and scathing\comma{} because how dare they? Don\apos{}Äôt they know who her father is?

Her favourite \apos{}Äúpossession\apos{}Äù is Norman\comma{} her white Norwegian forest cat familiar. He was given to her by Draco\comma{} as a \apos{}Äúgood luck at Hogwarts\apos{}Äù gift.  One day she\apos{}Äôd like to become an animagus.

	hasAcquired = 1, 
	acquired = Purchased prior to arriving at Hogwarts, 
	description = A simple set of black wizards robes with a colourful lining reflecting the Hogwarts House that you belong to. These robes are generally regarded as old fashioned and a bit odd to wear outside of school environs\comma{} but not totally unusual. 

These robes give you a +1 to all casting checks whilst you are wearing them.,

	name = Shield Hat, 
	amount = 1, 
	class = Clothing, 
	hasAcquired = 1, 
	acquired = Purchased from Weasley\apos{}s Wizarding Wheezes, 
	description = First developed by the Weasley twins as a prank item prior to the Second Wizarding War\comma{} the Ministry took a great interest in the Shield Hat as a defensive item. As a result\comma{} an entirely new line of (mostly) serious products were introduced. 

Outwardly\comma{} the shield hat appears to be a normal pointed wizard\apos{}s hat\comma{} though a peek inside the brim reveals some glowing enchanted runes. Once per day\comma{} the wearer can mentally trigger a the hat to produce a shield which projects outwards for a few moments\comma{} before quickly fading. 

This shield is equivalent to the {\it Force Field} spell cast at a third level. During the turn cycle in which the field is activated\comma{} an ethereal shield blooms into existence around the wearer.

Whenever an attack is performed against you whilst the shield is active\comma{} roll 2d4+2 and add this value to your Resist check or your Block value\comma{} as appropriate. If a successful Resist would limit the amount of damage taken\comma{} negate it entirely instead. 

If you fail to Resist\comma{} or the Accuracy exceeds your augmented Block value\comma{} the shield crumples and the spell is ended. The spell which broke the shield is then applied to you at half damage\comma{} with any other effects unmodified. Any other spells which hit you this round act as normal.,

	description = In a tribute to their father\comma{} the Weasley\apos{}s designed the Decoy Detonator to look like a slightly oversized rubber duck\comma{} though with a slightly random assortment of legs\comma{} wheels\comma{} caterpillar treads\comma{} and octopus tentacles stuck to the bottom. 

To activate a decoy detonator\comma{} crank the small handle on the back a couple of times\comma{} and release it. The detonator will scamper away on its mishmash of legs for a distance of up to 2d10 metres\comma{} before exploding with a loud flash. 

This explosion is not violent enough to do physical damage to all but the weakest of beings\comma{} but it provides an excellent distraction and diversion.,

	acquired = Found in the Junk Shop, 
	description = A stained and grubby metal chain\comma{} with what looks to be (beneath the grime) a gemstone of some kind. 

A magical investigation led you to understand that this was a very valuable bit of jewellery\comma{} though not in the best of conditions. The gemstone in the centre is a very large\comma{} very pure sapphire.,
