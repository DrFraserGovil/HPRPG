\inventory{
	name = Hogwarts Robes, 
	amount = 1, 
	class = Clothing, 
	hasAcquired = 1, 
	acquired = Purchased prior to arriving at Hogwarts, 
	description = A simple set of black wizards robes with a colourful lining reflecting the Hogwarts House that you belong to. These robes are generally regarded as old fashioned and a bit odd to wear outside of school environs\comma{} but not totally unusual. 

These robes give you a +1 to all casting checks whilst you are wearing them.,

\inventory{
	name = Shield Hat, 
	amount = 1, 
	class = Clothing, 
	hasAcquired = 1, 
	acquired = Purchased from Weasley\apos{}s Wizarding Wheezes, 
	description = First developed by the Weasley twins as a prank item prior to the Second Wizarding War\comma{} the Ministry took a great interest in the Shield Hat as a defensive item. As a result\comma{} an entirely new line of (mostly) serious products were introduced. 

Outwardly\comma{} the shield hat appears to be a normal pointed wizard\apos{}s hat\comma{} though a peek inside the brim reveals some glowing enchanted runes. Once per day\comma{} the wearer can mentally trigger a the hat to produce a shield which projects outwards for a few moments\comma{} before quickly fading. 

This shield is equivalent to the {\it Force Field} spell cast at a third level. During the turn cycle in which the field is activated\comma{} you have an impenetrable field which stops all spells and physical attacks from passing through it. 

This shield has a health of 40HP. If any attack would cause the shield to drop to 0HP\comma{} the shield is dispelled and half the remaining damage is dealt to the wearer.,

	acquired = Purchased from Weasley\apos{}s Wizarding Wheezes, 
	description = In a tribute to their father\comma{} the Weasley\apos{}s designed the Decoy Detonator to look like a slightly oversized rubber duck\comma{} though with a slightly random assortment of legs\comma{} wheels\comma{} caterpillar treads\comma{} and octopus tentacles stuck to the bottom. 

To activate a decoy detonator\comma{} crank the small handle on the back a couple of times\comma{} and release it. The detonator will scamper away on its mishmash of legs for a distance of up to 2d10 metres\comma{} before exploding with a loud flash. 

This explosion is not violent enough to do physical damage to all but the weakest of beings\comma{} but it provides an excellent distraction and diversion.,

	hasAcquired = 1, 
	acquired = Found in the Junk Shop, 
	description = A stained and grubby metal chain\comma{} with what looks to be (beneath the grime) a gemstone of some kind. 

A magical investigation led you to understand that this was a very valuable bit of jewellery\comma{} though not in the best of conditions. The gemstone in the centre is a very large\comma{} very pure sapphire., 
	hasCost = 1, 
	purchaseCost = \knut{5}, 
	sellValue = \galleon{7}
