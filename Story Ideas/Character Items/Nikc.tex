	hasAcquired = 1, 
	acquired = Given by Lomp as a gift, 
	description = A broken bucket with the bottom missing\comma{} and some eyeholes drilled into the side. 

The Hat of Buckets was invented by Nikc when he put a broken bucket on his head as a divergence for Lomp\comma{} the somewhate dim proprietor of the Junk Shop. Lomp was so impressed with the invention\comma{} he purchased the idea from Nikc\comma{} and gifted him the first prototype. 

This bucket provides an additional +1 to the Block statistic (though not from attacks from above....),

	hasAcquired = 1, 
	acquired = Purchased prior to arriving at Hogwarts, 
	description = A simple set of black wizards robes with a colourful lining reflecting the Hogwarts House that you belong to. These robes are generally regarded as old fashioned and a bit odd to wear outside of school environs\comma{} but not totally unusual.

	acquired = Purchased from Weasley\apos{}s Wizarding Wheezes, 
	description = First developed by the Weasley twins as a prank item prior to the Second Wizarding War\comma{} the Ministry took a great interest in the Shield Hat as a defensive item. As a result\comma{} an entirely new line of (mostly) serious products were introduced. 

Outwardly\comma{} the shield hat appears to be a normal pointed wizard\apos{}s hat\comma{} though a peek inside the brim reveals some glowing enchanted runes. Once per day\comma{} the wearer can mentally trigger a the hat to produce a shield which projects outwards for a few moments\comma{} before quickly fading. 

This shield is equivalent to the {\it Force Field} spell cast at a third level. During the turn cycle in which the field is activated\comma{} you have an impenetrable field which stops all spells and physical attacks from passing through it. 

This shield has a health of 40HP. If any attack would cause the shield to drop to 0HP\comma{} the shield is dispelled and half the remaining damage is dealt to the wearer.,

\begin{itemize}
\boldItem{Lay on Hands}{By placing your hands onto the chest of a wounded individual\comma{} you may restore 1d8 HP to them. This increases to 2d8 at 8th level\comma{} 3d8 at 14th level and 4d8 at 18th level. This takes a minor action\comma{} and you cannot use it on the same individual again until you have completed a Short Rest.}
\boldItem{Residual Ward}{You have a permanent warded shield around you. This shield has HP equal to twice your character level + your Intelligence modifier\comma{} and acts like the {\it Force Shield} spell. Whenever you cast a spell from the Recuperation school\comma{} restore HP to the shield equal to half the FP cost of the spell\comma{} this works even if the shield has reached 0HP and has failed â€“ the field immediately restores itself. The shield regains full strength on completing a long rest.}
\boldItem{Stabilising Field}{Whenever you fall below 0HP\comma{} you instead take the {\it Critical But Stable} condition. You regenerate HP at a rate of 1 per turn (max 0) until this condition is removed.}
\boldItem{Ward Reinforce}{Your wards regenerate strength at a rate of 2HP per turn. They cannot exceed their original strength using this effect.}
\end{itemize}
When casting a spell from the recuperation school\comma{} you may channel a part of the magical energy into the stone\comma{} altering its effects. This costs an additional 1FP. 

You may not have the effect of more than one magical Icon active at any one point. If you possess multiple such icons\comma{} you can decide which one is active. You can only change your choice after a long rest.,

\begin{itemize}
\boldItem{Minor Transmutation}{By tapping the stone against a simple object no more than 10kg in mass\comma{} made entirely of wood\comma{} stone\comma{} iron\comma{} copper or silver you may transform it into another of those materials. This lasts for 10 minutes\comma{} and the spell reverts.}
\boldItem{Claws}{As a minor action you may use the stone to grow a pair of wicked curved claw\minus{}like fingernails. Your unarmed attacks deal an additional 1d6 slashing damage.}
\boldItem{Purify}{By dropping the stone into a vessel of water\comma{} or rubbing against some food\comma{} you may instantly purify it\comma{} removing any poison\comma{} mould or other contaminants.}
\boldItem{Dimensional Anchor}{The stone anchors summoned objects to this reality for longer. The effective duration of Conjuration spells is increased by 50\%}
