The Hat of Buckets was invented by Nikc when he put a broken bucket on his head as a divergence for Lomp\comma{} the somewhate dim proprietor of the Junk Shop. Lomp was so impressed with the invention\comma{} he purchased the idea from Nikc\comma{} and gifted him the first prototype. 

This bucket provides an additional +1 to the Block statistic (though not from attacks from above....),

	description = First developed by the Weasley twins as a prank item prior to the Second Wizarding War\comma{} the Ministry took a great interest in the Shield Hat as a defensive item. As a result\comma{} an entirely new line of (mostly) serious products were introduced. 

Outwardly\comma{} the shield hat appears to be a normal pointed wizard\apos{}s hat\comma{} though a peek inside the brim reveals some glowing enchanted runes. Once per day\comma{} the wearer can mentally trigger a the hat to produce a shield which projects outwards for a few moments\comma{} before quickly fading. 

This shield is equivalent to the {\it Force Field} spell cast at a third level. During the turn cycle in which the field is activated\comma{} an ethereal shield blooms into existence around the wearer.

Whenever an attack is performed against you whilst the shield is active\comma{} roll 2d4+2 and add this value to your Resist check or your Block value\comma{} as appropriate. If a successful Resist would limit the amount of damage taken\comma{} negate it entirely instead. 

If you fail to Resist\comma{} or the Accuracy exceeds your augmented Block value\comma{} the shield crumples and the spell is ended. The spell which broke the shield is then applied to you at half damage\comma{} with any other effects unmodified. Any other spells which hit you this round act as normal.,
