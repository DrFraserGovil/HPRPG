If you fail to Resist\comma{} or the Accuracy exceeds your augmented Block value\comma{} the shield crumples and the spell is ended. The spell which broke the shield is then applied to you at half damage\comma{} with any other effects unmodified. Any other spells which hit you this round act as normal.
