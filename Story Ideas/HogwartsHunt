\\\\\\\\\\\  	THE HOGWARTS     ///////////
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\     HUNT      //////////////

This is a small mini-adventure designed to take one/two sessions to solve, and being completely separate from the rest of the game. Designed for low-level players in order to get ahold of the more free-form nature, it serves as an excellent jumping point from the structured `lesson' phase. 

** Getting into position **

In order to trigger the 'intro' scene, the PCs need to be maneouvered into the DADA classroom on the 3rd floor for a `special class'. This can be done by, for example, a notification at breakfast. If PCs elect not to go to the session, then they lose preparation days, and the event initiates at the prescribed time!


***  INTRO   ****

Upon sitting down at the back of the packed DADA classroom, you notice that it's not just Professor Bogoliubov (the DADA Professor) standing at the front: there are a large number of staff from across the school, clustered at the front of the dusty room, including the Headmistress herself! They are clustered into two groups at the front, either side of what looked like a large boulder, with a covered bird cage balanced precariously on top of it.

As the last few students file into the room, Professor McGonagall called for silence, and a hush fell across the room.  

"As many of you may know, the past few decades since the last Wizarding War have seen a huge upheaval of the magical way of life. Many of us have been forced to re-evaluate the way we live our lives, and the values that we hold dear -- and nowhere has this been closer to home than at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After all, *were* responsible for educating the vast majority of the Death Eaters. Hogwarts, like all things, must change with the times.

After a significant period of introspection, Hogwarts have decided that classroom based teaching should not necessarily always form the core of the magical curriculum. The Magical World is huge and varied, and these four walls -- " (Mcgonnagal gestures to the classroom around her) " -- cannot contain all the knowledge that you seek.

I am therefore very pleased to announce that over the next couple of days, you first years will be the first students to take part in an educational event we have come to call the "Hogwarts Hunt", a cross-disciplinary exercise designed to push you in to learning how to deal with real-life situations." 

The room fills with hushed whispers, as the students turned to one another and began speculating about what was going to happen next. McGonagall then hands over to Bogoliubov to explain what this even would entail. Bogoliubov walks to the centre of the classroom carrying a brown paper package, cleared her throat, she began to speak, with a hint of a Russian accent:

"Thank you professor McGonagall. It has been my pleasure to plan this first event, which we hope will become a regular feature of the education here at Hogwarts. Your goal over the next few days is simple: you need to find this:"

With that, Bogoliubov reveals the item she is carrying: a pair of black gloves, that seem to both shimmer, and absorb all light that fell on them simulatneously.

"This is a pair of legendary gloves, and they grant their owner some rather impressive perks, that any witch or wizard would find useful. There is one pair available. The first student to lay their hands on them gets to keep them. It is as simple as that."

The murmering in the room rises to such a level that Bogoliubov is forced to stop and wait for it to die down. 

"Today is Friday. On Thursday morning, I will give the gloves to this creature over here -- " (she gestures in the direction of the rock, and the birdcage balances atop it) -- "whereupon it will be moved to a predetermined location."

"Whilst I may have designed the overall task, other members of the faculty have decided to help you, by littering the castle with clues as to where these gloves might be. Of course, these clues are not going to be handed out freely: you're going to need to work for them."

"So what should you do before Thursday? Well, this is were you are going to need to put some prep work in. The library will be open extra hours to allow you access to extra research material, and the teachers will hold specialised spell workshops from 12-1 during weekdays. Use this time wisely, and equip yourself as best you can for Thursday!"

McGonagall chimed in from the side:

"Although this is a competition, as you are first years, we have a very strong no-dueling policy. Any hexes used on another student will immediately disqualify you from the task. Don't test me!

Otherwise....good luck!"


********* RULES *********

NO dueling. 

Gloves will be released in 6 days time.

First student to touch the gloves gets to keep them. 

There are animals roaming the grounds. You may enter into combat with them.

Library (non restricted section) is open until 11PM every night. Each teacher holds one specialised class per weekday 12-1, where you may automatically learn any spell of your choosing from their school of magic. You may attend only one of these sessions per day.

Forbidden Forest is not `forbidden' during the daytime, for the duration of this task.



******* HINTS ALONG THE WAY  *******

You may ask around in order to try and work out how to solve the puzzles prior to actually meeting them, such that you may use your prep days wisely. 



******* CHALLENGES  ***********

1) Transfiguration

Upon entering the transfiguration classroom, you see 11 square slabs (1mx1m) of white material (mass 600g) lying on the ground: 9 form a square grid, with the other 2 lying on either side. The non-grid square closest to the character flashes and transforms into solid gold. The remaining non-grid square flashes and turns into black obsidian. The grid squares also flash, and form a pattern of black gold and white. 

Solution: The grid is a naughts & crosses game. Students are gold, the `opponent' is obsidian. The goal is to win by transforming the relevant block into gold to win the game. If they transform the wrong block into gold, then the opponent gets a turn. If they try to transform a block into something other than gold, or transform an already coloured block, the game resets.


2) Charms

A simple test-your-strength machine & hammer is found in the charms classroom. 

Solution: The task is completed when the dinger hits the bell. Cannot be done with human strength. Requires a ~100kg object to be dropped from a height of 2m to trigger it (or some other clever way of manipulating the system)

3) Potions

You see a man chained and locked to a chair. Above his head is a sign which says "He knows something. Make him talk". There are potion ingredients littered around the room in little jars -- but no books are anywhere to be seen. 

Solution:  The man needs a 1d10 charisma check (with difficulty 13) in order to persuade them to tell them the truth. The ingredients for all potions can be found in the room (except for Joberknoll feather, which can only be found by returning the pair of glasses in the corner of the room to professor Longbottom, who has borrowed the supply). Illusion spells may be used in conjuction with the potions for maximum effect.

4) Protective Magic

Upon entering the warding & healing classroom, you see a crumpled figure lying in the centre of a circle of 6 stone effigies. These stone effigies are firing 1d6 `ictus' spells into the centre every  5 seconds, which begins 20 seconds after they enter the room.

Goal: The aim is to keep the figure alive for 2 minutes (12 combat rounds), after which the spells stop. The figure has 12HP. If he dies, the scenario is reset. The spells can be stopped either by the player physically placing themselves in the way of the spells, using defensive magic, constantly healing the figure, or by dragging them out of the circle completely. The figure gives a clue when they are a) safe, and b) above 12HP.

5) DADA

You enter into a long room, with a heavy looking door at the other end. On both sides of the room, a large number of levers (10 per wall) run along. Each glows with a different colour, and a soft hum emanates from them.

Goal: There is actually no trick here. The door at the other end is unlocked, and they may walk straight through it to get clue number 5. Every time they pull a lever, however, a nw creature is added to the room. GM rolls 1d4:
1 = Veles, 2 = 2x manuana, 3 = Zeugl, 4 = Shubin 



6) Divination


In the room are three cloaked figures, each with an engraved sign around their necks, numbering them 1,2 and 3. 

Number 1 says: "One of us is called Truth and always speaks the truth. One is called Falsehood and always tells lies. One is called Wisdom, and sometimes speaks the truth and sometimes lies."
Number 2 says: "Prove to us your guile and tell us who is who from our clues."
Number 3 says: "Find Truth, and ask them for the clue. They will provide what you seek".

They then turn, and point to each other:

1 says: "2 is Truth"
2 says: "I am Truth"
3 says: "1 is Truth"

Players may solve this riddle either logically, or using magic to deduce that: 1 is Wisdom, 2 is Truth and 3 is Falsehood. NOTE, HOWEVER: that it was 3 who said that Truth would provide the clue, and 3 is the liar. The solution is therefore to ask Number 1 for the clue. 

If you ask Wisdom for the clue, you gain clue number 6. If you ask Truth, you get the true but misleading clue number 7. If you ask Falsehood, you get the false clue number 8.

You may only get one of these clues. This task does not reset until after Solvei is defeated. 



******* ENDGAME CLUES ************

Upon completing each of the tasks, students are assigned one of the following clues as to the location of the gloves:

1)  GLOVES ARE WITH `Z'
2)  ALL `X's ARE `Y'
3)  BOGOLIUBOV IS `Y'
4)  HAGRID IS IN CHARGE OF `X's
5)  `Z' IS POGREBIN
6)  `Z' IS IN PLAIN SIGHT


Divination fake clues:
7)  SOLVEI THE 'Y' IS IN FOREST   (This is true, but 
8)  'Z' IS IN FOREST

The missing 
(X = BEAST, Y = RUSSIAN, BEAST)

******** ROAMING ANIMALS  ***********

The following animals can be found roaming around Hogwarts during this event:

0) Decoy Diricawl, teleporting around the entire grounds. To determine current location, roll a 1d20 (1=Great Hall, 2=Dungeons, 3=Viaduct, 4=Stone circle, 5 = Hagrids Hut, 6 = Transfiguration room, 7 = DADA, 8 = Charms, 9 = Hospital wing, 10 =Divination tower, 11 = Owlery, 12 = Quidditch Pitch

1) Single Solvei in a copse in the Forbidden Forest, carrying the Gloves of Solvei.

2) Shubin wandering around the dungeons.

3) Large number of Vodyanoi in the lake

4) Single Marzanna with 6 Manuana accompanying it, found at the Stone Circle

5) Frost Salamander in ~20% of classrooms (roll 1d6, if =6, salamander appears on entering room. Does not include library or hospital wing)

6) Zeugl near lake



********* GLOVE LOCATION ******

The Gloves of Muromets never leave the DADA classroom.

The rock in the introduction is actually a Pogrebin, a Russian `rock demon', which can turn into a rock at will. The Dodo/diricawl is merely a distraction (and the one-non Russian creature roaming free). 

To get the gloves, must awaken the pogrebin, at which point it will drop the gloves. They can then be gained either by force, or by stealth, ending the mission.

**** New Creatures  ****

Because of the very specific nature of the animals included in this story are part of the mystery, they are included here, rather than in the main Monster Manual.

The Veles are a species of anthropomorphic bears, native to the Ural Mountains. In traditional Slavic mythology, Veles (a singular entity) is considered to be the God of Mischief, and the arch-enemy of the god of storms.

He was supposedly killed by the legendary warrior Ilya Muromets -- a man known for his incredible strength and unerring accuracy with a bow. Recent sightings, however, mean that either Solvei survived, or that there is more than one of them.
