# HPRPG: Harry Potter and the Role-Playing Ha,e

A Harry Potter Role Playing Game

HPRPG was created to get my girlfriend -- a total roleplaying novice, but a huge Harry Potter fan -- involved in an RPG game in a familiar setting. 

This repository contains several important documents: the Core Rulebook, the accompanying Game Master's Guide and a CharacterSheet, as well as other accoutrements, such as a MLP potion-mixing script and the various code snippets required to compile the tex and data files into the relevant pdfs.
